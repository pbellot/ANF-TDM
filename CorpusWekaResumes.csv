"The threat of infection by conventional transfusion‐transmitted agents has been essentially eliminated from the blood supply in developed countries, thus focusing attention on the potential risk from emerging infections. Over recent years, actions have been taken to manage a number of such risks to blood safety. These illustrate the inherent variability of the agents concerned and of the measures needed to define and control the risk.","hematology"

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of a newly emerged disease SARS. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most abundant structural proteins and serves as a diagnostic marker for accurate and sensitive detection of the virus. Using a SELEX (systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment) procedure and recombinant N protein, we selected a high-affinity RNA aptamer capable of binding to N protein with a dissociation constant of 1.65 nM. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and RNA competition experiments showed that the selected aptamer recognized selectively the C-terminal region of N protein with high specificity. Using a chemiluminescence immunosorbent assay and a nanoarray aptamer chip with the selected aptamer as an antigen-capturing agent, we could sensitively detect N protein at a concentration as low as 2 pg/ml. These aptamerantibody hybrid immunoassays may be useful for rapid, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV N protein.","chemistry"
"Objective: To understand the association between the SARS outbreak and the environmental temperature, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against it. Methods: The daily numbers of the probable SARS patients and the daily meteorological factors during the SARS outbreak period in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan were used in the data analysis. Ecological analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily numbers of probable SARS patients and the environmental temperature and its variations. Results: There was a significant correlation between the SARS cases and the environmental temperature seven days before the onset and the seven day time lag corresponds well with the known incubation period for SARS. The optimum environmental temperature associated with the SARS cases was between 16°C to 28°C, which may encourage virus growth. A sharp rise or decrease in the environmental temperature related to the cold spell led to an increase of the SARS cases because of the possible influence of the weather on the human immune system. This study provided some evidence that there is a higher possibility for SARS to reoccur in spring than that in autumn and winter. Conclusion: Current knowledge based on case studies of the SARS outbreak in the four cities suggested that the SARS outbreaks were significantly associated with the temperature and its variations. However, because the fallacy and the uncontrolled confounding effects might have biased the results, the possibility of other meteorological factors having an affect on the SARS outbreaks deserves further investigation.","public"
"For clinical diagnosis, a small number of targets (2–10 biomarkers) are often all that is required for disease assessment and accurate early disease diagnosis. In the current paper we have developed novel, carrier-resolved, single-label-based multiplexed assays for the simultaneous detection and quantification of a limited number of DNA targets associated with breast cancer. In contrast to current encoding strategies, every hybridization signal for the corresponding DNA target in our protocol is uniquely immobilized onto one carrier vehicle with a unique and intrinsic physico-chemical signature. Moreover, a simple chemiluminescence setup is employed to read the carrier code instead of expensive and complicated flow-cytometer or imaging-systems commonly used for multiplexed assays. Herein we demonstrate a new protocol using three homogeneous carriers, i.e. thermo-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIP), polystyrene beads, and magnetic beads respectively. This new methodology allowed for the simultaneous determination of three oligonucleotide sequences (60 bases in length) associated with the breast cancer gene (BRCA1) and showed high selectivity and attomolar–femtomolar sensitivity. The mixture of three different capture probe conjugates first hybridizes with three corresponding target sequences, sandwiches with three biotinylated DNAs, and then reacts with peroxidase–streptavidin polymer in a single vessel without any washing, leading to the development of a ‘one-pot reaction system’. Only one washing step in our protocol is required prior to detection leading to our whole procedure being simple and efficient. The results show that the hybridization response to sample mixtures containing increasing levels of each target is proportional to the amount of corresponding DNA targets, indicating minimal cross-interferences. The work presented here validates the design and concept of a system for the detection of a limited number of DNA targets and provides the foundation for the development of highly sensitive techniques with increased multi-analyte capabilities.","chemistry"
"Bacterial storage lipids including poly(hydroxyalkanoates), triacylglycerols and wax esters are biodegradable materials with applications in food production, household goods, cosmetics, packaging and medicine. They are produced as a carbon and energy store by a wide range of species, and are accumulated in cytoplasmic granules. Various proteins are known to associate with these granules, thereby presenting the opportunity to functionalise their surfaces and to create biotechnologically applicable biobeads with the potential to replace existing colloidal systems for protein purification, drug delivery and enzyme immobilisation. This review summarises the production of such structures, and considers the methods available to adjust the physical properties of the granules to make them suitable for novel applications.","polymer"
"The development of glycan arrays has enabled the high-sensitivity and high-throughput analysis of carbohydrateprotein interactions and contributed to significant advances in glycomics. A number of new array platforms that allow for qualitative and quantitative analysis of mono- and multivalent interactions on surfaces have been developed recently. Glycan arrays are not only a powerful tool for basic research, but also a promising technique for medical diagnosis, and detection of pathogens and cancers. These studies also have led to the design of efficient carbohydrate-based antimicrobial or anticancer vaccines.","chemistry"
"Genetic polymorphisms have been demonstrated to be associated with vulnerability to human infection. ICAM3, an intercellular adhesion molecule important for T cell activation, and FCER2 (CD23), an immune response gene, both located on chromosome 19p13.3 were investigated for host genetic susceptibility and association with clinical outcome. A case-control study based on 817 patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 307 health care worker control subjects, 290 outpatient control subjects, and 309 household control subjects unaffected by SARS from Hong Kong was conducted to test for genetic association. No significant association to susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection was found for the FCER2 and the ICAM3 single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, patients with SARS homozygous for ICAM3 Gly143 showed significant association with higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (P=.0067; odds ratio [OR], 4.31 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37–13.56]) and lower total white blood cell counts (P=.022; OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.10–0.89]) on admission. These findings support the role of ICAM3 in the immunopathogenesis of SARS.","microbiology"
"Background. A unique genomic difference between human and civet severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) is that the former has a deletion of 29 nucleotides from open reading frame (orf) 8d that results in the generation of orf8a and orf8b. The objectives of the present study were to analyze antibody reactivity to ORF8a in patients with SARS and to elucidate the function of ORF8a. Methods. Western-blot and immunofluorescent antibody assays were used to detect anti-ORF8a antibody. SARS-CoV HKU39849 was used to infect stable clones expressing ORF8a and cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA). The virus loads (VLs) and cytopathic effects (CPEs) were recorded. Confocal microscopy and several mitochondria-related tests were used to study the function of ORF8a. Results. Two (5.4%) of 37 patients with SARS had anti-ORF8a antibodies. The VLs in the stable clones expressing ORF8a were significantly higher than those in control subjects 5 days after infection. siRNA against orf8a significantly reduced VLs and interrupted the CPE. ORF8a was found to be localized in mitochondria, and overexpression resulted in increases in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, caspase 3 activity, and cellular apoptosis. Conclusions. ORF8a not only enhances viral replication but also induces apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent pathway.","microbiology"
"Infection with the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)-associated coronavirus results in respiratory failure probably by immunological mechanisms in 10% of patients. Laboratory markers that predict subsequent respiratory failure would therefore be useful in patient management. We describe the clinical course, hematologic parameters, lymphocyte subpopulations and markers of inflammation in two patients with SARS, i.e., one man with diabetes mellitus and one pregnant woman, infected by the same viral isolate. The patient with underlying diabetes mellitus developed respiratory failure after admission in the second week of the illness while the second patient developed only a mild disease without respiratory failure. Subsequent respiratory dysfunction was associated with low numbers of Natural Killer (NK) cells at presentation and elevated CRP levels during the illness. NK cells and CRP levels at the end of the first week of the disease might be related to subsequent respiratory dysfunction and may link underlying conditions to disease severity.","medical"
"The year 2004 represents a milestone for the biosensor research community: in this year, over 1000 articles were published describing experiments performed using commercially available systems. The 1038 papers we found represent a ∼10% increase over the past year and demonstrate that the implementation of biosensors continues to expand at a healthy pace. We evaluated the data presented in each paper and compiled a ‘top 10’ list. These 10 articles, which we recommend every biosensor user reads, describe well‐performed kinetic, equilibrium and qualitative/screening studies, provide comparisons between binding parameters obtained from different biosensor users, as well as from biosensor‐ and solution‐based interaction analyses, and summarize the cutting‐edge applications of the technology. We also re‐iterate some of the experimental pitfalls that lead to sub‐optimal data and over‐interpreted results. We are hopeful that the biosensor community, by applying the hints we outline, will obtain data on a par with that presented in the 10 spotlighted articles. This will ensure that the scientific community at large can be confident in the data we report from optical biosensors. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","biophysics"
"We present an inexpensive, portable and integrated microfluidic instrument that is optimized to perform genetic amplification and analysis on a single sample. Biochemical reactions and analytical separations for genetic analysis are performed within tri-layered glass–PDMS microchips. The microchip itself consists of integrated pneumatically-actuated valves and pumps for fluid handling, a thin-film resistive element that acts simultaneously as a heater and a temperature sensor, and channels for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The platform is comprised of high voltage circuitry, an optical assembly consisting of a laser diode and a charged coupled device (CCD) camera, circuitry for thermal control, and mini-pumps to generate vacuum/pressure to operate the on-chip diaphragm-based pumps and valves. Using this microchip and instrument, we demonstrate an integration of reverse transcription (RT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). The novelty of this system lies in the cost-effective integration of microfluidics, optics, and electronics to realize a fully portable and inexpensive system (on the order of $1000 in component costs) for performing both genetic amplification and analysis – the basis of many medical diagnostics. We believe that this combination of portability, cost-effectiveness and performance will enable more accessible healthcare.","chemistry"

"The Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID) is a consortium of researchers at Seattle BioMed, Emerald BioStructures, the University of Washington and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory that was established to apply structural genomics approaches to drug targets from infectious disease organisms. The SSGCID is currently funded over a five‐year period by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to determine the three‐dimensional structures of 400 proteins from a variety of Category A, B and C pathogens. Target selection engages the infectious disease research and drug‐therapy communities to identify drug targets, essential enzymes, virulence factors and vaccine candidates of biomedical relevance to combat infectious diseases. The protein‐expression systems, purified proteins, ligand screens and three‐dimensional structures produced by SSGCID constitute a valuable resource for drug‐discovery research, all of which is made freely available to the greater scientific community. This issue of Acta Crystallographica Section F, entirely devoted to the work of the SSGCID, covers the details of the high‐throughput pipeline and presents a series of structures from a broad array of pathogenic organisms. Here, a background is provided on the structural genomics of infectious disease, the essential components of the SSGCID pipeline are discussed and a survey of progress to date is presented.","crystallography"
"The radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide caspase-3 inhibitor, [18F]2 (WC-II-89), is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis. The radiolabeling mechanism was studied by 13C NMR, ESI/MS, and computational calculations. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring, which served as a trap for [18F]fluoride, was responsible for the failure of the radiolabeling via nucleophilic substitution of the mesylate group in 7a by [18F]fluoride. Once treated with a strong base, 7a opened the isatin ring completely to form an isatinate intermediate 16, which lost the ability to trap [18F]fluoride, thereby allowing the displacement of the mesylate group to afford the 18F-labeled isatinate 17. [18F]17 can be converted to isatin [18F]2 efficiently under acidic conditions. The ring-opening and re-closure of the isatin ring under basic and acidic conditions were confirmed by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ESI/MS and 13C NMR studies. Computational studies of model compounds also support the above proposed mechanism. Similarly, the ring-opening and re-closure method was used successfully in the synthesis of the 11C labeled isatin sulfonamide analogue [11C]4 (WC-98). A microPET imaging study using [11C]4 in the Fas liver apoptosis model demonstrated retained activity in the target organ (liver) of the treated mice. Increased caspase-3 activation in the liver was verified by the fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme assay. Therefore, this study provides a useful method for radio-synthesis of isatin derivative radiotracers for PET and SPECT studies, and [11C]4 is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis.","chemistry"
"Gene silencing using RNA-interference, first described in mammalian systems almost a decade ago, is revolutionizing therapeutic target validation efforts both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the potential for using short interfering RNA (siRNA) as a therapy in its own right is also progressing at a significant pace. However, the widespread use of such approaches is contingent on having appropriate systems to achieve clinically appropriate, safe, and efficient delivery of siRNA. There are many physicochemical and biological barriers to such delivery, and a growing emphasis on the design and characterisation of non-viral technologies that will overcome these barriers and expedite targeted delivery. This review discusses the considerations and challenges associated with use of siRNA-based therapeutics, including stability and off-target effects. Speculation is made on the properties of an ideal delivery system and the non-viral delivery approaches used to date, both in vitro and in vivo, are classified and discussed. Moreover, the ability of cyclodextrin-based delivery vectors to fulfil many of the criteria of an ideal delivery construct is also elaborated.","biochemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new, highly contagious, viral disease, emerged in China late in 2002 and quickly spread to 32 countries and regions causing in excess of 774 deaths and 8098 infections worldwide. In the absence of a rapid diagnostic test, therapy or vaccine, isolation of individuals diagnosed with SARS and quarantine of individuals feared exposed to SARS virus were used to control the spread of infection. We examine mathematically the impact of isolation and quarantine on the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing using a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative infected cases and SARS&ndash;related deaths in the first three regions but not in Beijing until mid&ndash;April, when China started to report data more accurately. The results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals by isolating the latter is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks with or without quarantine. An optimal isolation programme entails timely implementation under stringent hygienic precautions defined by a critical threshold value. Values below this threshold lead to control, but those above are associated with the incidence of new community outbreaks or nosocomial infections, a known cause for the spread of SARS in each region. Allocation of resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement sub&ndash;optimal isolation and quarantine together. A community&ndash;wide eradication of SARS is feasible if optimal isolation is combined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of entry.","evolutionary"
"The study sought to identify factors involved in the emergence, prevention and elimination of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong during 11 March to 22 May 2003. A structured multiphase regression analysis was used to estimate the potential effects of weather, time and interaction effect of hospital infection. In days with a lower air temperature during the epidemic, the risk of increased daily incidence of SARS was 18·18-fold (95% confidence interval 5·6–58·8) higher than in days with a higher temperature. The total daily new cases might naturally decrease by an average of 2·8 patients for every 10 days during the epidemic. The multiplicative effect of infected hospital staff with patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) and the proportion of SARS patients in ICUs might respectively increase the risk of a larger SARS epidemic in the community. The provision of protective gear in hospitals was also a very important factor for the prevention of SARS infection. SARS transmission appeared to be dependent on seasonal temperature changes and the multiplicative effect of hospital infection. SARS also appeared to retreat naturally over time.","public"

"Background and Aims: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a virulent viral infection that affects a number of organs and systems. This study examined if SARS may result in cardiovascular complications. Methods and Results: 121 patients (37.5 (SD13.2) years, 36% male) diagnosed to have SARS were assessed continuously for blood pressure, pulse, and temperature during their stay in hopsital. Hypotension occurred in 61 (50.4%) patients in hospital, and was found in 28.1%, 21.5%, and 14.8% of patients during the first, second, and third week, respectively. Only one patient who had transient echocardiographic evidence of impaired left ventricular systolic function required temporary inotropic support. Tachycardia was present in 87 (71.9%) patients, and was found in 62.8%, 45.4%, and 35.5% of patients from the first to third week. It occurred independent of hypotension, and could not be explained by the presence of fever. Tachycardia was also present in 38.8% of patients at follow up. Bradycardia only occurred in 18 (14.9%) patients as a transient event. Reversible cardiomegaly was reported in 13 (10.7%) patients, but without clinical evidence of heart failure. Transient atrial fibrillation was present in one patient. Corticosteroid therapy was weakly associated with tachycardia during the second (χ2 = 3.99, p = 0.046) and third week (χ2 = 6.53, p = 0.01), although it could not explain tachycardia during follow up. Conclusions: In patients with SARS, cardiovascular complications including hypotension and tachycardia were common but usually self limiting. Bradycardia and cardiomegaly were less common, while cardiac arrhythmia was rare. However, only tachycardia persisted even when corticosteroid therapy was withdrawn.","medicine"
"Estimating detailed transmission trees that reflect the relationships between infected individuals or populations during a disease outbreak often provides valuable insights into both the nature of disease transmission and the overall dynamics of the underlying epidemiological process. These trees may be based on epidemiological data that relate to the timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected individuals. Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their inherently high mutation rate. Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees. We apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences from each infected farm and information on when farms were first estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on these farms were culled. Incorporating known infection links due to animal movement prior to imposition of the national movement ban results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41&hairsp;472 that are consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent more than 95% of the total likelihood calculated using a model that accounts for the epidemiological data. These trees differ in several ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic data.","evolutionary"
"On average, more than two new species of human virus are reported every year. We constructed the cumulative species discovery curve for human viruses going back to 1901. We fitted a statistical model to these data; the shape of the curve strongly suggests that the process of virus discovery is far from complete. We generated a 95% credible interval for the pool of as yet undiscovered virus species of 38&ndash;562. We extrapolated the curve and generated an estimate of 10&ndash;40 new species to be discovered by 2020. Although we cannot predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present, we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning. More systematic virus discovery programmes, covering both humans and potential animal reservoirs of human viruses, should be considered.","evolutionary"
"Purpose. A new strain of H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu was confirmed in the UK in May 2009 and has spread to over 100 countries around the world causing the World Health Organization to declare a global flu pandemic. The primary objectives of this review are to identify the key demographic and attitudinal determinants of three types of protective behaviour during a pandemic: preventive, avoidant, and management of illness behaviours, in order to describe conceptual frameworks in which to better understand these behaviours and to inform future communications and interventions in the current outbreak of swine flu and subsequent influenza pandemics. Methods. Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched for references to papers on severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza/flu, H5N1, swine influenza/flu, H1N1, and pandemics. Forward searching of the identified references was also carried out. In addition, references were gleaned from an expert panel of the Behaviour and Communications sub‐group of the UK Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Group. Papers were included if they reported associations between demographic factors, attitudes, and a behavioural measure (reported, intended, or actual behaviour). Results. Twenty‐six papers were identified that met the study inclusion criteria. The studies were of variable quality and most lacked an explicit theoretical framework. Most were cross‐sectional in design and therefore not predictive over time. The research shows that there are demographic differences in behaviour: being older, female and more educated, or non‐White, is associated with a higher chance of adopting the behaviours. There is evidence that greater levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of the diseases and greater belief in the effectiveness of recommended behaviours to protect against the disease are important predictors of behaviour. There is also evidence that greater levels of state anxiety and greater trust in authorities are associated with behaviour. Conclusions. The findings from this review can be broadly explained by theories of health behaviour. However, theoretically driven prospective studies are required to further clarify the relationship between demographic factors, attitudes, and behaviour. The findings suggest that intervention studies and communication strategies should focus on particular demographic groups and on raising levels of perceived threat of the pandemic disease and belief in the effectiveness of measures designed to protect against it.","psychology"
"Study objective: To establish a predictive scoring system and to determine its effectiveness for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases confirmed by RT-PCR in patients with fever. Methods: A study was conducted of 484 consecutive patients seen in the emergency department (ED) of our tertiary care center during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. The scoring system was divided into triage and screening station stages. Data were analysed with multivariable and logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 737 patients who presented to our ED for possible SARS from March to June 2003, we enrolled 484 patients with a temperature >38.0°C (>100.3°F) (age >18 years). Dyspnoea, diarrhoea, travel, close contact, hospital exposure, and household history were identified as predictive indicators in the triage stage. The triage score was the total of six items. With a one-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 81.8% (18/22) and 73.6% (340/462). Leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CXR were identified as predictive indicators in the fever screening stage. Screening station scores (the sum of 10 items) consisted of triage scores, white blood cell count, and CXR. With a three-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 95.5% (21/22) and 87.2% (403/462). Conclusions: Syndromic and traditional surveillance play a role in early identification of SARS in an endemic area. The SARS scoring system described is easily applicable and highly effective in screening patients during outbreaks.","emergency"
"Objectives: To determine paediatric emergency department (ED) staff perceptions of the effectiveness and practice of infection control measures against a novel virulent pathogen. Methods: All medical staff of the paediatric ED in a tertiary medical centre completed a written questionnaire near the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Level of concern regarding SARS, and perceptions of effectiveness and use of infection control measures were assessed on a 5 point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using χ2 test and one way analysis of variance with significance at p<0.05. Results: Response rate was 97% (116/120). All scores were given out of 5 possible points. Using isolation rooms (mean score 4.6), wearing a mask when examining patients (4.5), and handwashing (4.5) were considered most effective. Staff physicians reported handwashing more than nurses and trainees (4.9 v 4.5 and 4.5, respectively; p<0.05) while other measures were reported equally. Respondents considering SARS a high public health threat reported higher compliance with handwashing (4.8 v 4.4), always wearing a mask (3.9 vs 3.2) and gloves (3.6 v 2.9) in the ED (p<0.05), but not eye protection (3.4 v 3.0), gown use (4.9 v 4.7), or wearing a mask when examining patients (5.0 v 4.8). Staff who considered combined infection control measures effective in protecting patients and healthcare workers did not report increased compliance. Conclusions: Eye protection was perceived as only moderately effective in protecting against the spread of SARS, and reported compliance was relatively poor among ED staff. Concern of SARS as a public health threat rather than perceived effectiveness of infection control measures appears to have a greater impact on compliance.","emergency"
"The aim of this study is to explore the impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak on Chinese students living in Japan. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire. The participants were recruited at multiple locations at the University of Tokyo, Japan. The results showed approximately 60% (96/161) of the respondents felt an impact of SARS on college life; they had experienced SARS-related fear, worry, depression as well as social discrimination and had taken SARS prevention measures for daily protection in Japan during the epidemic. The magnitude of the impact was associated with sociodemographic factors, including their age, specialty, area of previous residence in China and length of stay in Japan. The findings suggest that the SARS outbreak had a psychosocial impact on the Chinese students living in Japan, even though none of them had SARS. Social support tailored for these foreign students should be provided during such a disease outbreak. Asia Pac J Public Health 2005; 17(2): 124-129.","public"
"At 14:28 on 12 May 2008, Sichuan Province of China suffered a devastating earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale with more than 80000 human lives lost and millions displaced. With inadequate shelter, poor access to health services, and disrupted ecology, the survivors were at enormous risk of infectious disease outbreaks. This work, believed to be unprecedented, was carried out to contain a possible outbreak through onsite monitoring of airborne biological agents in the high-risk areas. In such a mission, a mobile laboratory was developed using a customized vehicle along with state-of-art bioaerosol and molecular equipment and tools, and deployed to Sichuan 11 days after the earthquake. Using a high volume bioaerosol sampler (RCS High Flow) and Button Inhalable Aerosol Sampler equipped with gelatin filters, a total of 55 air samples, among which are 28 filter samples, were collected from rubble, medical centers, and camps of refugees, troops and rescue workers between 23 May and 9 June, 2008. After pre-treatment of the air samples, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), gel electrophoresis, limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to detect infectious agents and to quantify environmental toxins and allergens. The results revealed that, while high levels of endotoxin (180975 ng/m3) and (1,3)--d-glucans (11100 ng/m3) were observed, infectious agents such as Bacillus anthracis, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria meningitidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza A virus, bird flu virus (H5N1), enteric viruses, and Meningococcal meningitis were found below their detection limits. The total bacterial concentrations were found to range from 250 to 2.5 105 DNA copies/L.

"Since the discovery of interferons (IFNs), considerable progress has been made in describing the nature of the cytokines themselves, the signalling components that direct the cell response and their antiviral activities. Gene targeting studies have distinguished four main effector pathways of the IFN-mediated antiviral response: the Mx GTPase pathway, the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway, the protein kinase R pathway and the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway. As discussed in this Review, these effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication. Ongoing research continues to expose additional activities for these effector proteins and has revealed unanticipated functions of the antiviral response.","immunology"
"In analogy to evolution in biological processes, molecular evolution, based on the reversible formation of imines, has successfully been explored for drug discovery, receptor design and as a controlled-release vehicle. Multicomponent systems composed of amines and carbonyl compounds generate structural diversity by reversible reaction of the different components to form equilibrated dynamic mixtures or combinatorial libraries (DCLs). Under thermodynamic control and in the presence of an external factor which influences the equilibrium, these systems evolve by selective adaptation to the changing external conditions. This concept allows the casting of biologically or catalytically active substrates and the molding of receptors from DCLs which are composed of smaller non-active amine and carbonyl moieties. Similarly, if the amine or carbonyl compounds are the biologically active compounds of interest, the corresponding dynamic mixtures are found to be efficient delivery systems, allowing their controlled release over time.","chemistry"
"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease which was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS has caused an outbreak in the world during 2003 and 2004, with 8098 individuals being infected and a death toll of 774 in 28 regions around the world. Specific humoral responses to viral infection remain unclear. Objective: To analyse the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV genome and identify potential antigenic epitopes in the structural proteins. Methods: Potential antigenic epitopes were identified in the structural proteins (nucleocapsid, membrane, spike, and small envelope proteins) and hypothetical proteins (SARS3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b) that are specific for SARS-CoV. A peptide chip platform was created and the profiles of antibodies to these epitopes were investigated in 59 different SARS patients’ sera obtained 6–103 days after the onset of the illness. Serial sera from five additional patients were also studied. Results: Epitopes at the N-terminus of the membrane protein and the C-terminus of nucleocapsid protein elicited strong antibody responses. Epitopes on the spike protein were only moderately immunogenic but the effects were persistent. Antibodies were also detected for some putative proteins, noticeably the C-termini of SARS3a and SARS6. Conclusions: Important epitopes of the SARS-CoV genome that may serve as potential markers for the viral infection are identified. These specific antigenic sites may also be important for vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease.","pathology"

"Background. Infections caused by the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus range from mild upper respiratory tract syndromes to fatal diseases. However, studies comparing virological and immunological profile of different clinical severity are lacking. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 74 patients with pandemic H1N1 infection, including 23 patients who either developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died (ARDS-death group), 14 patients with desaturation requiring oxygen supplementation and who survived without ARDS (survived-without-ARDS group), and 37 patients with mild disease without desaturation (mild-disease group). We compared their pattern of clinical disease, viral load, and immunological profile. Results. Patients with severe disease were older, more likely to be obese or having underlying diseases, and had lower respiratory tract symptoms, especially dyspnea at presentation. The ARDS-death group had a slower decline in nasopharyngeal viral loads, had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and were more likely to have bacterial coinfections (30.4%), myocarditis (21.7%), or viremia (13.0%) than patients in the survived-without-ARDS or the mild-disease groups. Reactive hemophagocytosis, thrombotic phenomena, lymphoid atrophy, diffuse alveolar damage, and multiorgan dysfunction similar to fatal avian influenza A H5N1 infection were found at postmortem examinations. Conclusions. The slower control of viral load and immunodysregulation in severe cases mandate the search for more effective antiviral and immunomodulatory regimens to stop the excessive cytokine activation resulting in ARDS and death.","microbiology"

"Several outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) have alerted the health systems of the world this century. The treatment of SARS patients with inhibitors, targeting proteins similar to those observed in this coronavirus, has not achieved satisfactory results, and currently there is no effective treatment for its control. The main proteinase of SARS coronavirus (3CLpro or Mpro) is crucial for its replication process, and therefore it is a potential target for the development of anti-SARS drugs. This protease is constituted of two protomers (A and B), displaying an active site formed by the catalytic dyad His-41 Cys-145. In this work, the structure of Mpro (PDB 1UJ1) has been optimized using an MMFF94s force field and docked with AG7088, an inhibitor of the human rhinovirus 3C protease. This protein has structural and functional similarities with SARS Mpro. Docking between AG7088 and the protomers A and B of Mpro, using the FlexX/Cscore program of SYBYL 7.0, showed that the calculated protein–ligand binding affinity was more favorable for the complex with Protomer A than for Protomer B. In order to find a good inhibitor with a high protein binding affinity (BA), 1250 molecules derived from AG7088 were docked with protomer A of Mpro. Molecules (83 inhibitors) with BAs lower than −31 kcal mol−1 (BA of AG7088), and also capable of interacting with the protein within the active site pocket, were considered possible inhibitors of Mpro. The average BA of ligands in all complexes was −36 kcal mol−1, and the best presented a BA of −49 kcal mol−1, suggesting that this example could act as a good Mpro competitive inhibitor. The ligand, named GQAC-02441, was also docked with the non-optimized structure of 1UJ1, generating satisfactory BA values. Taken together, our results propose a new high affinity ligand for SARS Mpro, with inhibitory properties independent of slight structural changes in the protease.","chemistry"

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emergent virus responsible for a worldwide epidemic in 2003. The coronavirus spike proteins belong to class I fusion proteins, and are characterized by the existence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2. The HR1 region in coronaviruses is predicted to be considerably longer than that in other type I virus fusion proteins. Therefore the exact binding sequence to HR2 from the HR1 is not clear. In this study, we defined the region of HR1 that binds to HR2 by a series of biochemical and biophysical measures. Subsequently the defined HR1 (902−952) and HR2 (1145−1184) chains, which are different from previously defined binding regions, were linked together by a flexible linker to form a single-chain construct, 2-Helix. This protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and forms a typical six-helix coiled coil bundle. Highly conserved HR regions between mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV spike proteins suggest a similar three-dimensional structure for the two fusion cores. Here, we constructed a homology model for SARS coronavirus fusion core based on our biochemical analysis and determined the MHV fusion core structure. We also propose an important target site for fusion inhibitor design and several strategies, which have been successfully used in fusion inhibitor design for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for the treatment of SARS infection.","biochemistry"
"The requirement for analysis of large numbers of biomolecules for drug discovery and clinical diagnostics has driven the development of low-cost, flexible and high-throughput methods for simultaneous detection of multiple molecular targets in a single sample (multiplexed analysis). The technique that seems most likely to satisfy all of these requirements is the multiplexed suspension (bead-based) assay, which offers a number of advantages over alternative approaches such as ELISAs and microarrays. In a bead based assay, different probe molecules are attached to different beads (of a few tens of microns in size), which are then reacted in suspension with the target sample. After reaction, the beads must be identifiable in order to determine the attached probe molecule, and thus each bead must be labelled (encoded) with a unique identifier. A large number of techniques have been proposed for encoding beads. This critical review analyses each technology on the basis of its ability to fulfil the practical requirements of assays, whilst being compatible with low-cost, high-throughput manufacturing processes and high-throughput detection methods. As a result, we identify the most likely candidates to be used for future integrated device development for practical applications.","cell"
"In this study several SARS-CoV structural proteins and fragments were expressed in E. coli as GST or TRX fusion proteins. They were fabricated on a microarray and tested with sera from SARS patients. Antigenic screening indicated that recombinant GST-N2 fusion protein, the carboxy-terminus 213aa–423aa of N protein, was strongest positive and weakest non-specific compared with others. An indirect antibody ELISA method was developed and clinical positive and negative sera for their antibodies against GST-N2 fusion protein were assayed. 311 out of the 442 sera from clinical SARS inpatients, as well as 229 out of 302 sera from convalescent patients gave positive reactivities; positive rates were 70.4% and 75.8% respectively. Sera from a total of 2726 non-SARS patients and healthy individuals were tested and the false positive rate was only 0.07%. When the sensitivity control sample was diluted 1 ∶ 64, it yielded OD values above the cutoff value. Reported data showed that this was a relatively high degree of sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV antibody testing. The data indicate that GST-N2 fusion protein, which was screened by protein microarray, may be a valuable diagnostic antigen for the development of serological assays for SARS. In addition, protein microarray assay presents a higher positive rate and sensitivity (86.1% and 1 ∶ 200) compared with the traditional ELISA screening method, and could provide a rapid, parallel and high-throughput antigen screening platform.","chemistry"

The multitude of applications of this class of materials ranges from solar and electrical to uses in food, cosmetics and medicine. In this review, we initially highlight characteristic features of polymeric nanoscale assemblies as well as those built from biological units (lipids, nucleic acids and proteins). We give special consideration to protein nanoassemblies found in nature such as ferritin protein cages, bacterial microcompartments and vaults found in eukaryotic cells and designed protein nanoassemblies, such as peptide nanofibres and peptide nanotubes. Next, we focus on biomedical applications of these nanoscale assemblies, such as cell targeting, drug delivery, bioimaging and vaccine development. In the vaccine development section, we report in more detail the use of virus-like particles and self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticles as new vaccine delivery platforms.","multidisciplinary"

"Following the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics and worldwide concern about the next pandemic, whether influenza or multiple drug resistant tuberculosis, has underlined the importance of effective interventions into airborne disease transmission in indoor environments in a community. The engineering control measures available include ventilation dilution, use of high-efficiency particulate air filters in a room or in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, and use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation devices in ceiling area of a room or in the HVAC system. These methods are known to be effective in controlling or delaying airborne disease transmission in a single enclosure in both healthcare facilities and the community. However, there have been no studies of their relative effectiveness at the community level. This paper presents mathematical modeling of some engineering control strategies with a focus on ventilation and corresponding analysis of their relative effectiveness compared with other public health interventions in disease control in indoor environments at the community level. The results should help us to determine the most effective intervention strategies. We conclude that the engineering intervention methods such as building ventilation can be as effective as public health interventions and the ventilation rates specified in the existing standards such as ASHRAE 62 may be too low for the purpose of preventing or controlling airborne infectious diseases in indoor environments.","public"

"In viruses, programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) signals direct the translation of alternative proteins from a single mRNA. Given that many basic regulatory mechanisms were first discovered in viral systems, the current study endeavored to: (i) identify −1 PRF signals in genomic databases, (ii) apply the protocol to the yeast genome and (iii) test selected candidates at the bench. Computational analyses revealed the presence of 10 340 consensus −1 PRF signals in the yeast genome. Of the 6353 yeast ORFs, 1275 contain at least one strong and statistically significant −1 PRF signal. Eight out of nine selected sequences promoted efficient levels of PRF in vivo. These findings provide a robust platform for high throughput computational and laboratory studies and demonstrate that functional −1 PRF signals are widespread in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data generated by this study have been deposited into a publicly available database called the PRFdb. The presence of stable mRNA pseudoknot structures in these −1 PRF signals, and the observation that the predicted outcomes of nearly all of these genomic frameshift signals would direct ribosomes to premature termination codons, suggest two possible mRNA destabilization pathways through which −1 PRF signals could post-transcriptionally regulate mRNA abundance.","biochemistry"
"Protein ubiquitination has been identified as a regulatory mechanism in key cellular activities, and deubiquitination is recognized as an important step in processes governed by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers. Viruses are known to target ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifier pathways using various strategies, including the recruitment of host deubiquitinating enzymes. Deubiquitinating activities have recently been described for proteins from three different virus families (adenovirus, coronavirus and herpesvirus), and predicted for others. This review centers on structural-functional aspects that characterize the confirmed viral deubiquitinating enzymes, and their relationships to established families of cellular deubiquitinating enzymes.","biochemistry"
"The HIV-1 protein Nef inhibits antigen presentation by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I). We determined the mechanism of this activity by solving the crystal structure of a protein complex comprising Nef, the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain (MHC-I CD) and the μ1 subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1. A ternary, cooperative interaction clamps the MHC-I CD into a narrow binding groove at the Nef-μ1 interface, which encompasses the cargo-recognition site of μ1 and the proline-rich strand of Nef. The Nef C terminus induces a previously unobserved conformational change in μ1, whereas the N terminus binds the Nef core to position it optimally for complex formation. Positively charged patches on μ1 recognize acidic clusters in Nef and MHC-I. The structure shows how Nef functions as a clathrin-associated sorting protein to alter the specificity of host membrane trafficking and enable viral evasion of adaptive immunity.","cell"

In univariate analysis, contact with respiratory secretions elevated the odds ratio to 6·9 (95% CI 1·4–34·6, P=0·02).

"The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a previously unknown coronavirus called SARS‐CoV, had profound social and economic impacts worldwide. Since then, structure–function studies of SARS‐CoV proteins have provided a wealth of information that increases our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS. While no effective therapy is currently available, considerable efforts have been made to develop vaccines and drugs to prevent SARS‐CoV infection. In this review, some of the notable achievements made by SARS structural biology projects worldwide are examined and strategies for therapeutic intervention are discussed based on available SARS‐CoV protein structures. To date, 12 structures have been determined by X‐ray crystallography or NMR from the 28 proteins encoded by SARS‐CoV. One key protein, the SARS‐CoV main protease (Mpro), has been the focus of considerable structure‐based drug discovery efforts. This article highlights the importance of structural biology and shows that structures for drug design can be rapidly determined in the event of an emerging infectious disease.","crystallography"

Are there any correlations between environments in the variability, sign or magnitude of epistasis? Very few studies have tackled these questions. Here, we addressed them in the context of viral emergence. Most emerging viruses are RNA viruses with small genomes, overlapping reading frames and multifunctional proteins for which epistasis is abundant. Understanding the effect of host species in the sign and magnitude of epistasis will provide insights into the evolutionary ecology of infectious diseases and the predictability of viral emergence.","evolutionary"

However, our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms and biological consequences of UBL conjugation is a significant hurdle to identifying drug-like inhibitors of enzyme targets within these pathways.

"Virus contamination in human therapeutics is of growing concern as more therapeutic products from animal or human sources come into the market. All biopharmaceutical processes are required to have at least two distinct viral clearance steps to remove viruses. Most of these steps work well for enveloped viruses and large viruses, whether enveloped or not. That leaves a class of small non‐enveloped viruses, like parvoviruses and hepatitis A, which are not easily removed by these typical steps. In this study, we report the identification of trimeric peptides that bind specifically to porcine parvovirus (PPV) and their potential use to remove this virus from process solutions. All of the trimeric peptides isolated completely removed all detectable PPV from buffer in the first nine column volumes, corresponding to a clearance of 4.5–5.5 log of infectious virus. When the virus was spiked into a more complex matrix consisting of 7.5% human blood plasma, one of the trimers, WRW, was able to remove all detectable PPV in the first three column volumes, after which human blood plasma began to interfere with the binding of the virus to the peptide resin. These trimer resins removed considerably more virus than weak ion exchange resins. The results of this work indicate that small peptide ligand resins have the potential to be used in virus removal processes where removal of contaminating virus is necessary to ensure product safety.","food"
"By revisiting the air distribution and bioaerosol dispersion in Ward 8A where the largest nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in Hong Kong in 2003, we found an interesting phenomenon. Although all the cubicles were in ‘positive pressure’ towards the corridor, the virus-containing bioaerosols generated from the index patient's cubicle were still transmitted to other cubicles, which cannot be explained in a traditional manner. A multi-zone model combining the two-way airflow effect was used to analyse this phenomenon. The multi-zone airflow model was evaluated by our experimental data. Comparing with the previous computational fluid dynamic simulation results, we found that the air exchange owing to the small temperature differences between cubicles played a major role in SARS transmission. Additionally, the validated multi-zone model combining the two-way airflow effect could simulate the pollutant transport with reasonable accuracy but much less computational time. A probable improvement in general ward design was also proposed.","multidisciplinary"

"Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are members of the newly defined Henipavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae. Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in up to 70% of infected patients, and there is increasing evidence of human‐to‐human transmission. NiV is designated a priority pathogen in the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda, and could be a devastating agent of agrobioterrorism if used against the pig farming industry. Endothelial syncytium is a pathognomonic feature of NiV infections, and is mediated by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins. This review summarizes what is known about the pathophysiology of NiV infections, and documents the identification of the NiV receptor. EphrinB2, the NiV and HeV receptor, is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons, consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV. We discuss how the identification of the henipahvirus receptor sheds light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and how it will spur the rational development of effective therapeutics. In addition, ephrinB3, a related protein, can serve as an alternative receptor, and we suggest that differential usage of ephrinB2 versus B3 may explain the variant pathogenic profiles observed between NiV and HeV. Thus, identifying the NiV receptors opens the door for a more comprehensive analysis of the envelope–receptor interactions in NiV pathobiology. Finally, we also describe how galectin‐1 (an innate immune defense lectin) can interact with specific N‐glycans on the Nipah envelope fusion protein, underscoring the potential role that innate immune defense mechanisms may play against emerging pathogens.","multidisciplinary"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly found infectious disease that is caused by a novel human coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). Because the mortality rate of SARS patients is very high, understanding the pathological mechanisms of SARS not only in vivo but in vitro is important for the prevention of SARS. Activation of signaling pathways caused by SARS‐CoV infection leads to the phosphorylation and activation of downstream molecules. Two conflicting cellular programs, apoptosis to eliminate virus‐infected cells and survival to delay apoptosis by producing antiviral cytokines, occur in SARS patients. Recent studies regarding SARS and SARS‐CoV have clarified that activation of mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs) plays important roles in upregulation of cytokine expression and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Both Akt and p38 MAPK are keys for determination of cell survival or death in SARS‐CoV‐infected cells in vitro. Agents being developed to target these signaling cascades may be important for the design of anti‐SARS‐CoV drugs.

"Understanding the risk of airborne transmission can provide important information for designing safe healthcare environments with an appropriate level of environmental control for mitigating risks. The most common approach for assessing risk is to use the Wells&ndash;Riley equation to relate infectious cases to human and environmental parameters. While it is a simple model that can yield valuable information, the model used as in its original presentation has a number of limitations. This paper reviews recent developments addressing some of the limitations including coupling with epidemic models to evaluate the wider impact of control measures on disease progression, linking with zonal ventilation or computational fluid dynamics simulations to deal with imperfect mixing in real environments and recent work on dose&ndash;response modelling to simulate the interaction between pathogens and the host. A stochastic version of the Wells&ndash;Riley model is presented that allows consideration of the effects of small populations relevant in healthcare settings and it is demonstrated how this can be linked to a simple zonal ventilation model to simulate the influence of proximity to an infector. The results show how neglecting the stochastic effects present in a real situation could underestimate the risk by 15 per cent or more and that the number and rate of new infections between connected spaces is strongly dependent on the airflow. Results also indicate the potential danger of using fully mixed models for future risk assessments, with quanta values derived from such cases less than half the actual source value.","multidisciplinary"

"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that caused a global outbreak in 2003. Research has shown that it is caused by a novel coronavirus. A series of cases is reported where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on tears had demonstrated the presence of the virus. Detection of ocular infection from tears using the PCR technique has been widely used by ophthalmologists to diagnose infections for other viruses. Methods: This is a case series report from cases classified as probable or suspect SARS cases. Tear samples were collected from 36 consecutive patients who were suspected of having SARS in Singapore over a period of 12 days (7–18 April 2003), and analysed by PCR using protocols developed by the WHO network of laboratories. Results: Three patients with probable SARS (one female and two male patients) had positive results from their tear samples. Tear samples were used to confirm SARS in the female patient, who was positive only from her tears. The positive specimens were found in cases sampled early in their course of infection. Conclusions: This is the first case series reported with the detection of the SARS coronavirus from tears, and has important implications for the practice of ophthalmology and medicine. The ability to detect and isolate the virus in the early phase of the disease may be an important diagnostic tool for future patients and tear sampling is both simple and easily repeatable. Many healthcare workers are in close proximity to the eyes of patients and this may be a source of spread among healthcare workers and inoculating patients. Ophthalmic practices may need to change as more stringent barrier methods, appropriate quarantine, and isolation measures are vital when managing patients with SARS.","ophthalmology"
"Animal reservoirs for infectious diseases pose ongoing risks to human populations. In this theory of zoonoses, the introduction event that starts an epidemic is assumed to be independent of all preceding events. However, introductions are often concentrated in communities that bridge the ecological interfaces between reservoirs and the general population. In this paper, we explore how the risks of disease emergence are altered by the aggregation of introduction events within bridge communities. In viscous bridge communities, repeated introductions can elevate the local prevalence of immunity. This local herd immunity can form a barrier reducing the opportunities for disease emergence. In some situations, reducing exposure rates counterintuitively increases the emergence hazards because of off-setting reductions in local immunity. Increases in population mixing can also increase emergence hazards, even when average contact rates are conserved. Our theory of bridge communities may help guide prevention and explain historical emergence events, where disruption of stable economic, political or demographic processes reduced population viscosity at ecological interfaces.","evolutionary"
"Ribosomal frameshifting on viral RNAs relies on the mechanical properties of structural elements, often pseudoknots and more rarely stem-loops, that are unfolded by the ribosome during translation. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 type B a long hairpin containing a three-nucleotide bulge is responsible for efficient frameshifting. This three-nucleotide bulge separates the hairpin in two domains: an unstable lower stem followed by a GC-rich upper stem. Toeprinting and chemical probing assays suggest that a hairpin-like structure is retained when ribosomes, initially bound at the slippery sequence, were allowed multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles. However, while the upper stem remains intact the lower stem readily melts. After the first, and single step of translocation of deacylated tRNA to the 30 S P site, movement of the mRNA stem-loop in the 5′ direction is halted, which is consistent with the notion that the downstream secondary structure resists unfolding. Mechanical stretching of the hairpin using optical tweezers only allows clear identification of unfolding of the upper stem at a force of 12.8 ± 1.0 pN. This suggests that the lower stem is unstable and may indeed readily unfold in the presence of a translocating ribosome.","biochemistry"
"Some zoonotic pathogens cause sporadic infection in humans but rarely propagate further, while others have succeeded in overcoming the species barrier and becoming established in the human population. Adaptation, driven by selection pressure in human hosts, can play a significant role in allowing pathogens to cross this species barrier. Here we use a simple mathematical model to study potential epidemiological markers of adaptation. We ask: under what circumstances could ongoing adaptation be signalled by large clusters of human infection? If a pathogen has caused hundreds of cases but with little transmission, does this indicate that the species barrier cannot be crossed? Finally, how can case reports be monitored to detect an imminent emergence event? We distinguish evolutionary scenarios under which adaptation is likely to be signalled by large clusters of infection and under which emergence is likely to occur without any prior warning. Moreover, we show that a lack of transmission never rules out adaptability, regardless of how many zoonoses have occurred. Indeed, after the first 100 zoonotic cases, continuing sporadic zoonotic infections without onward, human-to-human transmission offer little extra information on pathogen adaptability. Finally, we present a simple method for monitoring outbreaks for signs of emergence and discuss public health implications.","evolutionary"
"We isolated and characterized 10 microsatellite loci in the western long‐fingered bat, Miniopterus magnater. These loci were tested on 48 individuals from Anhui Province of China, and all loci were highly polymorphic. The mean number of observed alleles per locus was 13.6 (range from six to 27). Observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.364 to 0.957, and from 0.676 to 0.951, respectively. After Bonferroni correction, four loci deviated significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. No pairs of loci were in linkage disequilibrium. These polymorphic markers will be used to examine population structure and genetic diversity in this species.","evolutionary"
"Various infectious agents are known to be transmitted naturally via respiratory aerosols produced by infected patients. Such aerosols may be produced during normal activities by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. The schlieren optical method, previously applied mostly in engineering and physics, can be effectively used here to visualize airflows around human subjects in such indoor situations, non-intrusively and without the need for either tracer gas or airborne particles. It accomplishes this by rendering visible the optical phase gradients owing to real-time changes in air temperature. In this study, schlieren video records are obtained of human volunteers coughing with and without wearing standard surgical and N95 masks. The object is to characterize the exhaled airflows and evaluate the effect of these commonly used masks on the fluid-dynamic mechanisms that spread infection by coughing. Further, a high-speed schlieren video of a single cough is analysed by a computerized method of tracking individual turbulent eddies, demonstrating the non-intrusive velocimetry of the expelled airflow. Results show that human coughing projects a rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air, but that wearing a surgical or N95 mask thwarts this natural mechanism of transmitting airborne infection, either by blocking the formation of the jet (N95 mask), or by redirecting it in a less harmful direction (surgical mask).","multidisciplinary"
"BACKGROUND: Globally, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) is a newly emerging virus that causes SARS with high mortality rate in infected people. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) is an important antigen for the early diagnosis of SARS and the detection of diseases. Here, a new quantum dots (QDs)‐conjugated RNA aptamer with high sensitivity and rapidity is proposed for the detection of SARS‐CoV N protein using an on chip system. RESULTS: A QDs‐conjugated RNA aptamer can specifically hybridize on the immobilized SARS‐CoV N protein on the surface of a glass chip. Detection is based on the optical signal variation of a QDs‐supported RNA aptamer interacting on an immobilized protein chip. Using an optical QDs‐based RNA aptamer chip, SARS N protein was detected at concentrations as low as 0.1 pg mL−1. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that the QDs‐conjugated RNA aptamer could interact on a designed chip specifically and sensitively. This device could form a QDs‐conjugated biosensor prototype chip for SARS‐CoV N protein diagnosis. The proposed visual SARS‐CoV N protein detection technique may avoid the limitations of other reported methods because of its high sensitivity, good specificity, ease of use, and the ability to perform one‐spot monitoring.

"The release of the soluble form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha from the plasma membrane occurs through the activation of the secretase tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE). The current study was designed to examine whether the anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies (Abs) are capable to regulate TACE expression in non-neoplastic human salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) cultures. We investigated the effect of anti-Ro/SSA Abs on the localization and abundance of cell-surface TACE and on TACE pro-domain-shedding and activation. In addition, the potential physiological consequences of TNF-alpha blockage by the biological agent Adalimumab on post-translational regulation of TACE are discussed. Anti-Ro/SSA Abs were purified from IgG fractions of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome, using Sepharose 4B-Ro/SSA affinity columns. Flow cytometry, reverse transcription–PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to study TACE expression on SGEC and TACE regulation by Abs. Our study demonstrated a dose-dependent increase of TACE messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in anti-Ro/SSA Abs-treated SGEC, followed by internalization, pro-domain shedding and activation of TACE protein, suggesting that increased TACE activity is necessary for the release of TNF-alpha observed in anti-Ro/SSA Abs-stimulated SGEC. Adalimumab treatment brought TACE mRNA and surface TACE expression to levels than those observed in untreated SGEC. These data suggest that the effect of anti-Ro/SSA Abs on TACE expression and intracellular distribution is exerted by TNF-alpha production.","immunology"
"Nanoengineering exploits the interactions of materials at the nanometre scale to create functional nanostructures. It relies on the precise organization of nanomaterials to achieve unique functionality. There are no interactions more elegant than those governing nucleic acids via Watson–Crick base-pairing rules. The infinite combinations of DNA/RNA base pairs and their remarkable molecular recognition capability can give rise to interesting nanostructures that are only limited by our imagination. Over the past years, creative assembly of nucleic acids has fashioned a plethora of two-dimensional and three-dimensional nanostructures with precisely controlled size, shape and spatial functionalization. These nanostructures have been precisely patterned with molecules, proteins and gold nanoparticles for the observation of chemical reactions at the single molecule level, activation of enzymatic cascade and novel modality of photonic detection, respectively. Recently, they have also been engineered to encapsulate and release bioactive agents in a stimulus-responsive manner for therapeutic applications. The future of nucleic acid-based nanoengineering is bright and exciting. In this review, we will discuss the strategies to control the assembly of nucleic acids and highlight the recent efforts to build functional nucleic acid nanodevices for nanomedicine.","biology"
"We identified 1219 articles published in 2006 that described work performed using commercial optical biosensor platforms. It is interesting to witness how the biosensor market is maturing with an increased number of instrument manufacturers offering a wider variety of platforms. However, it is clear from a review of the results presented that the advances in technology are outpacing the skill level of the average biosensor user. While we can track a gradual improvement in the quality of the published work, we clearly have a long way to go before we capitalize on the full potential of biosensor technology. To illustrate what is right with the biosensor literature, we highlight the work of 10 groups who have their eye on the ball. To help out the rest of us who have the lights on but nobody home, we use the literature to address common myths about biosensor technology. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","biophysics"
"Interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of hundreds of genes as part of an elaborate antimicrobial programme designed to combat infection in all nucleated cells — a process termed cell-autonomous immunity. As described in this Review, recent genomic and subgenomic analyses have begun to assign functional properties to novel IFN-inducible effector proteins that restrict bacteria, protozoa and viruses in different subcellular compartments and at different stages of the pathogen life cycle. Several newly described host defence factors also participate in canonical oxidative and autophagic pathways by spatially coordinating their activities to enhance microbial killing. Together, these IFN-induced effector networks help to confer vertebrate host resistance to a vast and complex microbial world.","immunology"
"Two factors dominated the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2002&ndash;2003 global outbreak, namely super-spreading events (SSE) and hospital infections. Although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified. We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission. We propose that in future outbreaks of SARS or other directly transmissible respiratory pathogens, simple mathematical models could be used to validate preliminary conclusions concerning the relative importance of different routes of transmission with important implications for infection control.","evolutionary"
"We present a general analytical result for the probability that a newly introduced pathogen will evolve adaptations that allow it to maintain itself within any novel host population, as a function of disease life-history parameters. We demonstrate that this probability of &lsquo;evolutionary emergence&rsquo; depends on two key properties of the disease life history: (i) the basic reproduction number and (ii) the expected duration of an infection. These parameters encapsulate all of the relevant information and can be combined in a very simple expression, with estimates for the rates of adaptive mutation, to predict the probability of emergence for any novel pathogen. In general, diseases that initially have a large reproductive number and/or that cause relatively long infections are the most prone to evolutionary adaptation.","evolutionary"

"In a cohort of 38 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), we observed leukopenia in 47% of patients, lymphopenia in 84%, and T lymphopenia in 95%. CD4+ T lymphocyte levels were reduced in 100% of patients, CD8+ T lymphocyte levels were reduced in 87%, B lymphocyte levels were reduced in 76%, and natural killer cell levels were reduced in 55%. Our data suggested that these patients' immune systems were impaired during the course of SARS. The absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets demonstrated a clinical significance for patients with SARS.","microbiology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first natural disaster that challenged the Chinese people at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It was caused by a novel animal coronavirus, never recognized or characterized before. This SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) exploited opportunities provided by &lsquo;wet markets&rsquo; in southern China to adapt to the palm civet and human. Under the positive selection pressure of human host, certain mutated lineages of the virus became readily transmissible between humans and thus caused the epidemic of 2002&ndash;2003. This review will provide first-hand information, particularly from Guangdong, China, about the initial epidemiology, the identification of the aetiological agent of the disease, the molecular evolution study of the virus, the finding of SARS-like CoV in horseshoe bats and the mechanistic analysis for the cross-host tropism transition. The substantial scientific contributions made by the Chinese scientists towards understanding the virus and the disease will be emphasized. Along with the description of the scientific discoveries and analyses, the significant impact of these researches upon the public health measurement or regulations will be highlighted. It is aimed to appreciate the concerted and coordinated global response that controlled SARS within a short period of time as well as the research strategy and methodology developed along with this process, which can be applied in response to other public health challenges, particularly the future emerging/re-merging infectious diseases.","biology"
"In an alternate reading frame overlapping the viral envelope gene, HIV‐1 has been shown to encoded a truncated glutathione peroxidase (GPx) module. Essential active site residues of the catalytic core regions of mammalian GPx sequences are conserved in the putative viral GPx (vGPx, encoded by the env‐fs gene). Cells transfected with an HIV‐1 env‐fs construct show up to a 100% increase in GPx enzyme activity, and are protected against the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and subsequent cell death induced by exogenous oxidants or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. An intact vGPx gene was observed to be more common in HIV‐1‐infected long‐term non‐progressors, as compared to HIV‐1 isolates from patients developing AIDS. An antioxidant/antiapoptotic protective role of the vGPx is also consistent with the observation that −1 frameshifting induced by the HIV‐1 env‐fs sequence AAAAAGA (which contains a potential “hungry” arginine codon, AGA) increases during arginine deficiency, which has been associated with increased oxidative stress. Under arginine‐limited conditions, nitric oxide synthase generates superoxide, which rapidly combines with NO to form peroxynitrite, which can cause activated T‐cells to undergo apoptosis. Thus, biosynthesis of the HIV‐1 GPx as an adaptive response to low arginine conditions might delay oxidant‐induced apoptotic cell death, providing an enhanced opportunity for viral replication.","endocrinology"

"China has a strong background in X-ray crystallography dating back to the 1920s. Protein crystallography research in China was first developed following the successful synthesis of insulin in China in 1966. The subsequent determination of the three-dimensional structure of porcine insulin made China one of the few countries which could determine macromolecular structures by X-ray diffraction methods in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After a slow period during the 1970s and 1980s, protein crystallography in China has reached a new climax with a number of outstanding accomplishments. Here, I review the history and progress of protein crystallography in China and detail some of the recent research highlights, including the crystal structures of two membrane proteins as well as the structural genomics initiative in China.","biology"

"In the summer of 2003, as the first global severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic stuttered to a close, The Royal Society set about organizing a meeting that would take stock of the year's events and ask &lsquo;what can we learn from SARS about emerging infections in general?&rsquo; Emerging infections are more than just a current biological fashion. The bitter ongoing experience of AIDS and the looming threat of an influenza pandemic teach us that the control of infectious disease is a problem we have not yet solved. It is a problem that needs to be addressed by a broad community. Scientists, policy makers and health care workers all need to be prepared, but prepared to do what? The purpose of the meeting was to use SARS as an example to enumerate the generic issues that must be considered when planning for the control of emerging infections.","biology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS&ndash;CoV) moved into humans from a reservoir species and subsequently caused an epidemic in its new host. We know little about the processes that allowed the cross&ndash;species transfer of this previously unknown virus. I discuss what we have learned about the movement of viruses into humans from studies of influenza A, both how it crossed from birds to humans and how it subsequently evolved within the human population. Starting with a brief review of severe acute respiratory syndrome to highlight the kinds of problems we face in learning about this viral disease, I then turn to influenza A, focusing on three topics. First, I present a reanalysis of data used to test the hypothesis that swine served as a &lsquo;mixing vessel&rsquo; or intermediate host in the transmission of avian influenza to humans during the 1918 Spanish flu&rsquo; pandemic. Second, I review studies of archived viruses from the three recent influenza pandemics. Third, I discuss current limitations in using molecular data to study the evolution of infectious disease. Although influenza A and SARS&ndash;CoV differ in many ways, our knowledge of influenza A may provide important clues about what limits or favours cross&ndash;species transfers and subsequent epidemics of newly emerging pathogens.","biology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a new disease in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China in late 2002. Within weeks it had spread to Hong Kong and thence globally to affect over 25 countries across five continents. The disease had the propensity to cause clusters of pneumonia, particularly in healthcare workers or close family contacts. A global effort coordinated by the World Health Organization successfully defined the aetiology, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the disease, and the implementation of case identification, isolation and infection control measures led to the interruption of the global outbreak by July 2003. The pattern of disease emergence and strategies for control of SARS provides lessons for coping with future emerging infectious disease threats.","biology"
"The case fatality was the lowest (3.8%) among 1512 cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong Province, China.

There was a close linkage between civet cats and humans in terms of transmission of SARS. Strict control of the wild&ndash;animal market may be significant in preventing a new outbreak of SARS this year.","biology"
"With outbreaks of infectious disease emerging from animal sources, we have learnt to expect the unexpected. We were, and are, expecting a new influenza A pandemic, but no one predicted the emergence of an unknown coronavirus (CoV) as a deadly human pathogen. Thanks to the preparedness of the international network of influenza researchers and laboratories, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was rapidly identified, but there is no complacency over the global or local management of the epidemic in terms of public health logistics. The human population was lucky that only a small proportion of infected persons proved to be highly infectious to others, and that they did not become so before they felt ill. These were the features that helped to make the outbreak containable. The next outbreak of another kind of transmissible disease may well be quite different.","biology"
"The sudden arrival of an internationally spreading outbreak of a newly identified infectious disease in early 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), provided an opportunity for a coordinated international response based on information and evidence obtained in real time through standard and electronic communications. Its containment represents a new way of working internationally, and demonstrates how intense collaboration in virology, clinical medicine and epidemiology can rapidly provide the information necessary to create and implement evidence&ndash;based control measures. The SARS outbreak serves as a reminder of the need for a strong national surveillance and response to infectious diseases, evidence&ndash;based international travel recommendations, and a global alert and response network to serve as a safety net when national surveillance fails.","biology"
"Proof that a newly identified coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS&ndash;CoV) is the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) came from a series of studies on experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). SARS&ndash;CoV&ndash;infected macaques developed a disease comparable to SARS in humans; the virus was re&ndash;isolated from these animals and they developed SARS&ndash;CoV&ndash;specific antibodies. This completed the fulfilment of Koch's postulates, as modified by Rivers for viral diseases, for SARS&ndash;CoV as the aetiological agent of SARS. Besides the macaque model, a ferret and a cat model for SARS&ndash;CoV were also developed. These animal models allow comparative pathogenesis studies for SARS&ndash;CoV infections and testing of different intervention strategies. The first of these studies has shown that pegylated interferon&ndash;&alpha;, a drug approved for human use, limits SARS&ndash;CoV replication and lung damage in experimentally infected macaques. Finally, we argue that, given the worldwide nature of the socio&ndash;economic changes that have predisposed for the emergence of SARS and avian influenza in Southeast Asia, such changes herald the beginning of a global trend for which we are ill prepared.","biology"
"This paper reviews current understanding of the epidemiology, transmission dynamics and control of the aetiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We present analyses of data on key parameters and distributions and discuss the processes of data capture, analysis and public health policy formulation during the SARS epidemic are discussed. The low transmissibility of the virus, combined with the onset of peak infectiousness following the onset of clinical symptoms of disease, transpired to make simple public health measures, such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts, very effective in the control of the SARS epidemic. We conclude that we were lucky this time round, but may not be so with the next epidemic outbreak of a novel aetiological agent. We present analyses that help to further understanding of what intervention measures are likely to work best with infectious agents of defined biological and epidemiological properties. These lessons learnt from the SARS experience are presented in an epidemiological and public health context.","biology"
"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of 2003 in Canada was unprecedented in several respects. Understanding the psychological impact of the outbreak on healthcare workers, especially those in hospitals, is important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. This review draws upon qualitative and quantitative studies of the SARS outbreak in Toronto to outline the factors that contributed to healthcare workers' experiencing the outbreak as a psychological trauma. Overall, it is estimated that a high degree of distress was experienced by 29&ndash;35% of hospital workers. Three categories of contributory factors were identified. Relevant contextual factors were being a nurse, having contact with SARS patients and having children. Contributing attitudinal factors and processes were experiencing job stress, perceiving stigmatization, coping by avoiding crowds and colleagues, and feeling scrutinized. Pre&ndash;existing trait factors also contributed to vulnerability. Lessons learned from the outbreak include: (i) that effort is required to mitigate the psychological impact of infection control procedures, especially the interpersonal isolation that these procedures promote; (ii) that effective risk communication is a priority early in an outbreak; (iii) that healthcare workers may have a role in influencing patterns of media coverage that increase or decrease morale; (iv) that healthcare workers benefit from resources that facilitate reflection on the effects of extraordinary stressors; and (v) that healthcare workers benefit from practical interventions that demonstrate tangible support from institutions.","biology"
"This study analyses the relationship between war and population. The impact of the growth and decline of population on important types of warfare&mdash;great power, small power, civil war as well as terrorism&mdash;is illustrated, with the objective in each case to be descriptive of risk. I find that population change has a significant impact on each, with the greatest causal impact on small power conflicts, civil war and upon terrorism. I conclude with some reasons for guarded optimism about the incorporation of population as a component of analysis in the discipline of international studies, and for the potential to devise new solutions to prevent conflict.","biology"
"The factors that determine the origin and fate of cross-species transmission events remain unclear for the majority of human pathogens, despite being central for the development of predictive models and assessing the efficacy of prevention strategies. Here, we describe a flexible Bayesian statistical framework to reconstruct virus transmission between different host species based on viral gene sequences, while simultaneously testing and estimating the contribution of several potential predictors of cross-species transmission. Specifically, we use a generalized linear model extension of phylogenetic diffusion to perform Bayesian model averaging over candidate predictors. By further extending this model with branch partitioning, we allow for distinct host transition processes on external and internal branches, thus discriminating between recent cross-species transmissions, many of which are likely to result in dead-end infections, and host shifts that reflect successful onwards transmission in the new host species. Our approach corroborates genetic distance between hosts as a key determinant of both host shifts and cross-species transmissions of rabies virus in North American bats. Furthermore, our results indicate that geographical range overlap is a modest predictor for cross-species transmission, but not for host shifts. Although our evolutionary framework focused on the multi-host reservoir dynamics of bat rabies virus, it is applicable to other pathogens and to other discrete state transition processes.","biology"
"Viral pathogens continue to emerge among humans, domesticated animals and cultivated crops. The existence of genetic variance for resistance in the host population is crucial to the spread of an emerging virus. Models predict that rapid spread decreases with the frequency and diversity of resistance alleles in the host population. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis are scarce. Arabiodpsis thaliana—tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) provides an experimentally suitable pathosystem to explore the interplay between genetic variation in host's susceptibility and virus diversity. Systemic infection of A. thaliana with TEV is controlled by three dominant loci, with different ecotypes varying in susceptibility depending on the genetic constitution at these three loci. Here, we show that the TEV adaptation to a susceptible ecotype allowed the virus to successfully infect, replicate and induce symptoms in ecotypes that were fully resistant to the ancestral virus. The value of these results is twofold. First, we showed that the existence of partially susceptible individuals allows for the emerging virus to bypass resistance alleles that the virus has never encountered. Second, the concept of resistance genes may only be valid for a well-defined viral genotype but not for polymorphic viral populations.","biology"
"RNA viruses may be particularly capable of contributing to the increasing biomedical problem of infectious disease emergence. Empirical studies and epidemiological models are informative for the understanding of evolutionary processes that promote pathogen emergence, but rarely are these approaches combined in the same study. Here, we used an epidemiology model containing observations of pathogen productivity in reservoirs, as a means to predict which pathogens should be most prone to emerge in a primary host such as humans. We employed as a model system a collection of vesicular stomatitis virus populations that had previously diverged in host-use strategy: specialists, directly selected generalists and indirectly selected (fortuitous) generalists. Using data from experiments where these viral strategists were challenged to grow on unencountered novel hosts in vitro, logistic growth models determined that the directly selected generalist viruses tended to grow best on model reservoirs. Furthermore, when we used the growth data to estimate average reproductive rate across secondary reservoirs, we showed that the combined approach could be used to estimate relative success of the differing virus strategists when encountering a primary host. Our study suggests that synergistic approaches combining epidemiological modelling with empirical data from experimental evolution may be useful for developing efforts to predict which types of pathogens pose the greatest probability of emerging in the future.","biology"
"When pathogens encounter a novel environment, such as a new host species or treatment with an antimicrobial drug, their fitness may be reduced so that adaptation is necessary to avoid extinction. Evolutionary emergence is the process by which new pathogen strains arise in response to such selective pressures. Theoretical studies over the last decade have clarified some determinants of emergence risk, but have neglected the influence of fitness on evolutionary rates and have not accounted for the multiple scales at which pathogens must compete successfully. We present a cross-scale theory for evolutionary emergence, which embeds a mechanistic model of within-host selection into a stochastic model for emergence at the population scale. We explore how fitness landscapes at within-host and between-host scales can interact to influence the probability that a pathogen lineage will emerge successfully. Results show that positive correlations between fitnesses across scales can greatly facilitate emergence, while cross-scale conflicts in selection can lead to evolutionary dead ends. The local genotype space of the initial strain of a pathogen can have disproportionate influence on emergence probability. Our cross-scale model represents a step towards integrating laboratory experiments with field surveillance data to create a rational framework to assess emergence risk.","biology"
"Identification of dominant T cell epitopes within newly emerging and re-emerging infectious organisms is valuable in understanding pathogenic immune responses and potential vaccine designs. However, difficulties in obtaining samples from patients or convalescent subjects have hampered research in this direction. We demonstrated a strategy, tetramer-guided epitope mapping, that specific CD4+ T cell epitopes can be identified by using PBMC from subjects that have not been exposed to the infectious organism. Sixteen HLA-DR0401- and 14 HLA-DR0701-restricted epitopes within spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were identified. Among these, spike protein residues 159–171, 166–178, 449–461 and 1083–1097 were identified to contain naturally processed immunodominant epitopes based on strong in vitro T cell responses of PBMC (as assayed by tetramer staining) to intact spike protein stimulation. These immunodominant epitopes were confirmed in vivo in HLA-DR0401 transgenic mice by immunizing with spike protein. Furthermore, the epitope-specific T cells from naive donors secreted IFN-γ and IL-13 upon re-stimulation with corresponding tetramers. Our study demonstrates a strategy to determine potential immunodominant epitopes for emerging infectious pathogens prior to their epidemic circulation.","immunology"

"Many serious emerging zoonotic infections have recently arisen from bats, including Ebola, Marburg, SARS-coronavirus, Hendra, Nipah, and a number of rabies and rabies-related viruses, consistent with the overall observation that wildlife are an important source of emerging zoonoses for the human population. Mechanisms underlying the recognized association between ecosystem health and human health remain poorly understood and responding appropriately to the ecological, social and economic conditions that facilitate disease emergence and transmission represents a substantial societal challenge. In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings. In this review, we propose a novel framework for the holistic and interdisciplinary investigation of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers, using the spillover of bat pathogens as a case study. This study has been developed to gain a detailed interdisciplinary understanding, and it combines cutting-edge perspectives from both natural and social sciences, linked to policy impacts on public health, land use and conservation.","biology"
"The outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and the subsequent identification of its animal origin study have heightened the world's awareness of animal-borne or zoonotic pathogens. In addition to SARS, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV), H5N1, and the lower pathogenicity H9N2 AIV have expanded their host ranges to infect human beings and other mammalian species as well as birds. Even the &lsquo;well-known&rsquo; reservoir animals for influenza virus, migratory birds, became victims of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Not only the viruses, but bacteria can also expand their host range: a new disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, caused by human Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection, has been observed in China with 52 human fatalities in two separate outbreaks (1998 and 2005, respectively). Additionally, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection has increased worldwide with severe disease. Several outbreaks and sporadic isolations of this pathogen in China have made it an important target for disease control. A new highly pathogenic variant of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been isolated in both China and Vietnam recently; although PRRSV is not a zoonotic human pathogen, its severe outbreaks have implications for food safety. All of these pathogens occur in Southeast Asia, including China, with severe consequences; therefore, we discuss the issues in this article by addressing the situation of the zoonotic threat in China.","biology"
"Infectious diseases of livestock are a major threat to global animal health and welfare and their effective control is crucial for agronomic health, for safeguarding and securing national and international food supplies and for alleviating rural poverty in developing countries. Some devastating livestock diseases are endemic in many parts of the world and threats from old and new pathogens continue to emerge, with changes to global climate, agricultural practices and demography presenting conditions that are especially favourable for the spread of arthropod-borne diseases into new geographical areas. Zoonotic infections that are transmissible either directly or indirectly between animals and humans are on the increase and pose significant additional threats to human health and the current pandemic status of new influenza A (H1N1) is a topical example of the challenge presented by zoonotic viruses. In this article, we provide a brief overview of some of the issues relating to infectious diseases of livestock, which will be discussed in more detail in the papers that follow.","biology"
"There are 219 virus species that are known to be able to infect humans. The first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to four new species are still being found every year. Extrapolation of the discovery curve suggests that there is still a substantial pool of undiscovered human virus species, although an apparent slow-down in the rate of discovery of species from different families may indicate bounds to the potential range of diversity. More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human hosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A few possible predictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of phylogenetically conserved cell receptors. It seems almost inevitable that new human viruses will continue to emerge, mainly from other mammals and birds, for the foreseeable future. For this reason, an effective global surveillance system for novel viruses is needed.","biology"
"Formal, quantitative approaches are now widely used to make predictions about the likelihood of an infectious disease outbreak, how the disease will spread, and how to control it. Several well-established methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the ‘art of the possible’, which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for ‘good practice’ for the development and the use of predictive models.","biology"
"The recent appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS&ndash;CoV) highlights the continual threat to human health posed by emerging viruses. However, the central processes in the evolution of emerging viruses are unclear, particularly the selection pressures faced by viruses in new host species. We outline some of the key evolutionary genetic aspects of viral emergence. We emphasize that, although the high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide them with great adaptability and explain why they are the main cause of emerging diseases, their limited genome size means that they are also subject to major evolutionary constraints. Understanding the mechanistic basis of these constraints, particularly the roles played by epistasis and pleiotropy, is likely to be central in explaining why some RNA viruses are more able than others to cross species boundaries. Viral genetic factors have also been implicated in the emergence of SARS&ndash;CoV, with the suggestion that this virus is a recombinant between mammalian and avian coronaviruses. We show, however, that the phylogenetic patterns cited as evidence for recombination are more probably caused by a variation in substitution rate among lineages and that recombination is unlikely to explain the appearance of SARS in humans.","biology"
"The emergence of new viral infections of man requires the development of robust diagnostic tests that can be applied in the differential diagnosis of acute illness, or to determine past exposure, so as to establish the true burden of disease. Since the recognition in April 2003 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS&ndash;CoV) as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), enormous efforts have been applied to develop molecular and serological tests for SARS which can assist rapid detection of cases, accurate diagnosis of illness and the application of control measures. International progress in the laboratory diagnosis of SARS&ndash;CoV infection during acute illness has led to internationally agreed World Health Organization criteria for the confirmation of SARS. Developments in the dissection of the human immune response to SARS indicate that serological tests on convalescent sera are essential to confirm SARS infection, given the sub&ndash;optimal predictive value of molecular detection tests performed during acute SARS illness.","biology"
"The search for animal host origins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has so far remained focused on wildlife markets, restaurants and farms within China. A significant proportion of this wildlife enters China through an expanding regional network of illegal, international wildlife trade. We present the case for extending the search for ancestral coronaviruses and their hosts across international borders into countries such as Vietnam and Lao People's Democratic Republic, where the same guilds of species are found on sale in similar wildlife markets or food outlets. The three species that have so far been implicated, a viverrid, a mustelid and a canid, are part of a large suite of small carnivores distributed across this region currently overexploited by this international wildlife trade. A major lesson from SARS is that the underlying roots of newly emergent zoonotic diseases may lie in the parallel biodiversity crisis of massive species loss as a result of overexploitation of wild animal populations and the destruction of their natural habitats by increasing human populations. To address these dual threats to the long&ndash;term future of biodiversity, including man, requires a less anthropocentric and more interdisciplinary approach to problems that require the combined research expertise of ecologists, conservation biologists, veterinarians, epidemiologists, virologists, as well as human health professionals.","biology"
"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) infection is mostly asymptomatic (AS) but 20% of subjects report WNV fever and 1% of patients experience neurologic diseases with higher rates in elderly and immunosuppressed persons. With no treatment and no vaccine to prevent the development of symptomatic (S) infections, it is essential to understand prognostic factors influencing S disease outcome. Host genetic background has been linked to the development of WNV neuroinvasive disease. This study investigates the association between the ABO and D blood group status and WNV disease outcome. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The distribution of blood groups was investigated within a cohort of 374 WNV+ blood donors including 244 AS and 130 S WNV+ blood donors. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between A, B, O, and D blood groups and WNV clinical disease outcome. RESULTS: S WNV+ donors exhibited increased frequencies of blood group A (S 47.6%, AS 36.8%, p = 0.04; odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01‐2.40) and D– individuals (S 21.5%, AS 13.1%, p = 0.03; OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.04‐3.18). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a genetic susceptibility placing blood group A and D– individuals at risk for the development of S disease outcome after WNV infection.","hematology"

"This paper proposes a quantitative model of the reaction-diffusion type to examine the distribution of interferon-α (IFNα) in a lymph node (LN). The numerical treatment of the model is based on using an original unstructured mesh generation software Ani3D and nonlinear finite volume method for diffusion equations. The study results in suggestion that due to the variations in hydraulic conductivity of various zones of the secondary lymphoid organs the spatial stationary distribution of IFNα is essentially heterogeneous across the organs. Highly protected domains such as sinuses, conduits, co-exist with the regions in which where the stationary concentration of IFNα is lower by about 100-fold. This is the first study where the spatial distribution of soluble immune factors in secondary lymphoid organs is modelled for a realistic three-dimensional geometry.","multidisciplinary"
"Enveloped viruses have evolved complex glycoprotein machinery that drives the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, permitting entry of the viral genome into the cell. For the paramyxoviruses, the fusion (F) protein catalyses this membrane merger and entry step, and it has been postulated that the F protein undergoes complex refolding during this process. Here we report the crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation, stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain. The structure of the F protein shows that there are profound conformational differences between the pre- and postfusion states, involving transformations in secondary and tertiary structure. The positions and structural transitions of key parts of the fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and two helical heptad repeat regions, clarify the mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by the F protein.","multidisciplinary"
"Although an increasing number of phylogenetic data sets are incomplete, the effect of ambiguous data on phylogenetic accuracy is not well understood. We use 4-taxon simulations to study the effects of ambiguous data (i.e., missing characters or gaps) in maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian frameworks. By introducing ambiguous data in a way that removes confounding factors, we provide the first clear understanding of 1 mechanism by which ambiguous data can mislead phylogenetic analyses. We find that in both ML and Bayesian frameworks, among-site rate variation can interact with ambiguous data to produce misleading estimates of topology and branch lengths. Furthermore, within a Bayesian framework, priors on branch lengths and rate heterogeneity parameters can exacerbate the effects of ambiguous data, resulting in strongly misleading bipartition posterior probabilities. The magnitude and direction of the ambiguous data bias are a function of the number and taxonomic distribution of ambiguous characters, the strength of topological support, and whether or not the model is correctly specified. The results of this study have major implications for all analyses that rely on accurate estimates of topology or branch lengths, including divergence time estimation, ancestral state reconstruction, tree-dependent comparative methods, rate variation analysis, phylogenetic hypothesis testing, and phylogeographic analysis.","evolutionary"
"Objectives/Hypothesis The objective was to describe the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the services of the division of otorhinolaryngology—head and neck surgery at an academic tertiary referral hospital in Hong Kong. Study Design Descriptive. Methods Records of general and subspecialty outpatient attendance, ward admissions, ward bed occupancy, and elective and emergency surgery were obtained for the period since the SARS outbreak and for an equivalent period before the outbreak. The changes in these parameters were determined against the background of new SARS cases. Results Since the outbreak of SARS in March 2003, the weekly outpatient clinic attendance has declined by 59%, the number of operations performed by 79%, the average ward bed occupancy rate by 79% and the daily admission rate by 84%. A dramatic increase of 300% in the number of patients defaulting on their outpatient appointments was recorded. Conclusion The substantial decrease in otorhinolaryngological services at an academic tertiary referral hospital in Hong Kong has been multifaceted. The decrease in attendance at the outpatient clinics reflects the increased number of patients defaulting on their appointments. Nonessential elective surgery was suspended soon after the outbreak, accounting for the decrease in the number of surgical procedures performed and partially for the decrease in ward bed occupancy and ward admissions. The temporary closure of the accident and emergency department contributed to the decrease in ward admissions and emergency surgical procedures. The reduced service offered by the hospital is having an impact on the quality of care available to patients with non–life‐threatening otorhinolaryngological conditions.","otorhinolaryngology"
"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the principal etiologic agent of SARS. We analyzed serum samples obtained from 623 patients with SARS in Beijing, to determine whether infection with SARS-CoV can elicit neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Methods. We developed a highly sensitive and safe neutralization assay using the SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus and used this assay to determine the titers of the NAbs in serum samples from patients with SARS. Results. We found that 85.9% of serum samples contained NAbs against SARS-CoV and that most of the NAb activities could be attributed to immunoglobulin G. The NAbs became detectable first at 5–10 days after the onset of symptoms, and their levels peaked at 20–30 days and then were sustained for >150 days. The serum samples could neutralize the pseudotype particles bearing the spike glycoproteins from different SARS-CoV strains, suggesting that the NAbs to SARS-CoV were broadly reactive. Conclusions. NAbs to SARS-CoV are broadly elicited in patients with SARS and, according to their kinetics, may correlate with viral load during the early stages of the disease. These results suggest that it is possible to develop effective vaccines against SARS and that NAbs provide a potential strategy for treating patients with SARS.","microbiology"

"Nearly 75% of all emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) that impact or threaten human health are zoonotic. The majority have spilled from wildlife reservoirs, either directly to humans or via domestic animals. The emergence of many can be attributed to predisposing factors such as global travel, trade, agricultural expansion, deforestation/habitat fragmentation, and urbanization; such factors increase the interface and/or the rate of contact between human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations, thereby creating increased opportunities for spillover events to occur. Infectious disease emergence can be regarded as primarily an ecological process. The epidemiological investigation of EIDs associated with wildlife requires a trans‐disciplinary approach that includes an understanding of the ecology of the wildlife species, and an understanding of human behaviours that increase risk of exposure. Investigations of the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 provide useful case studies. The emergence of Nipah virus was associated with the increased size and density of commercial pig farms and their encroachment into forested areas. The movement of pigs for sale and slaughter in turn led to the rapid spread of infection to southern peninsular Malaysia, where the high‐density, largely urban pig populations facilitated transmission to humans. Identifying the factors associated with the emergence of SARS in southern China requires an understanding of the ecology of infection both in the natural reservoir and in secondary market reservoir species. A necessary extension of understanding the ecology of the reservoir is an understanding of the trade, and of the social and cultural context of wildlife consumption. Emerging infectious diseases originating from wildlife populations will continue to threaten public health. Mitigating and managing the risk requires an appreciation of the connectedness between human, livestock and wildlife health, and of the factors and processes that disrupt the balance.","veterinary"
"“Super-spread events” (SSEs), which have been observed in Singapore, Hong Kong in China and many cities all over the world, usually have a large influence on the early course of the epidemics. The understanding of these SSEs is critical to the containment of SARS. In this letter it is shown that the possibility of SSEs is still high enough even when the virulences are equal for all the infective individuals, based on a simple spatial-relevant Monte Carlo model (SEIR). The long latent periods play a critical role in the appearance of SSEs. The heterogeneity of the activities of infective cases can also increase the possibility.","physics"
"Viral pathogens often induce strong effector CD4+ T cell responses that are best known for their ability to help B cell and CD8+ T cell responses. However, recent studies have uncovered additional roles for CD4+ T cells, some of which are independent of other lymphocytes, and have described previously unappreciated functions for memory CD4+ T cells in immunity to viruses. Here, we review the full range of antiviral functions of CD4+ T cells, discussing the activities of these cells in helping other lymphocytes and in inducing innate immune responses, as well as their direct antiviral roles. We suggest that all of these functions of CD4+ T cells are integrated to provide highly effective immune protection against viral pathogens.","immunology"

In this perspective, we present our contribution to the field of enzyme inhibitor discovery using a useful approach that allows diversification of a common core in a microtiter plate followed by in situ screening. Our method relies on an organic reaction that is highly selective, high yielding, amenable to the microscale and preferably can be performed in water. The core can be a designed molecule based on the structural and mechanistic information of the target, a compound with a weak binding affinity, or a natural product.

"The performance of three filtering facepiece respirators (two models of N99 and one N95) challenged with an inert aerosol (NaCl) and three virus aerosols (enterobacteriophages MS2 and T4 and Bacillus subtilis phage)—all with significant ultrafine components—was examined using a manikin-based protocol with respirators sealed on manikins. Three inhalation flow rates, 30, 85, and 150 l min−1, were tested. The filter penetration and the quality factor were determined. Between-respirator and within-respirator comparisons of penetration values were performed. At the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), >3% of MS2 virions penetrated through filters of both N99 models at an inhalation flow rate of 85 l min−1. Inhalation airflow had a significant effect upon particle penetration through the tested respirator filters. The filter quality factor was found suitable for making relative performance comparisons. The MPPS for challenge aerosols was <0.1 μm in electrical mobility diameter for all tested respirators. Mean particle penetration (by count) was significantly increased when the size fraction of <0.1 μm was included as compared to particles >0.1 μm. The filtration performance of the N95 respirator approached that of the two models of N99 over the range of particle sizes tested (∼0.02 to 0.5 μm). Filter penetration of the tested biological aerosols did not exceed that of inert NaCl aerosol. The results suggest that inert NaCl aerosols may generally be appropriate for modeling filter penetration of similarly sized virions.","public"
"Gene annotation in viruses often relies upon similarity search methods. These methods possess high specificity but some genes may be missed, either those unique to a particular genome or those highly divergent from known homologs. To identify potentially missing viral genes we have analyzed all complete viral genomes currently available in GenBank with a specialized and augmented version of the gene finding program GeneMarkS. In particular, by implementing genome‐specific self‐training protocols we have better adjusted the GeneMarkS statistical models to sequences of viral genomes. Hundreds of new genes were identified, some in well studied viral genomes. For example, a new gene predicted in the genome of the Epstein–Barr virus was shown to encode a protein similar to α‐herpesvirus minor tegument protein UL14 with heat shock functions. Convincing evidence of this similarity was obtained after only 12 PSI‐BLAST iterations. In another example, several iterations of PSI‐BLAST were required to demonstrate that a gene predicted in the genome of Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 encodes a BALF1‐like protein which is thought to be involved in apoptosis regulation and, potentially, carcinogenesis. New predictions were used to refine annotations of viral genomes in the RefSeq collection curated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Importantly, even in those cases where no sequence similarities were detected, GeneMarkS significantly reduced the number of primary targets for experimental characterization by identifying the most probable candidate genes. The new genome annotations were stored in VIOLIN, an interactive database which provides access to similarity search tools for up‐to‐date analysis of predicted viral proteins.","biochemistry"
"The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a previously unidentified coronavirus, SARS‐CoV. The RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS‐CoV plays a pivotal role in viral replication and is a potential target for anti‐SARS therapy. There is a lack of structural or biochemical data on any coronavirus polymerase. To provide insights into the structure and function of SARS‐CoV RdRp, we have located its conserved motifs that are shared by all RdRps, and built a three‐dimensional model of the catalytic domain. The structural model permits us to discuss the potential functional roles of the conserved motifs and residues in replication and their potential interactions with inhibitors of related enzymes. We predict important structural attributes of potential anti‐SARS‐CoV RdRp nucleotide analog inhibitors: hydrogen‐bonding capability for the 2′ and 3′ groups of the sugar ring and C3′ endo sugar puckering, and the absence of a hydrophobic binding pocket for non‐nucleoside analog inhibitors similar to those observed in hepatitis C virus RdRp and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase. We propose that the clinically observed resistance of SARS to ribavirin is probably due to perturbation of the conserved motif A that controls rNTP binding and fidelity of polymerization. Our results suggest that designing anti‐SARS therapies can benefit from successful experiences in design of other antiviral drugs. This work should also provide guidance for future biochemical experiments.","biochemistry"

"We recently reported that the intronic splice-site mutation IVS3-8G>A of CHRNA1 that encodes the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α subunit disrupts binding of a splicing repressor, hnRNP H. This, in turn, results in exclusive inclusion of the downstream exon P3A. The P3A(+) transcript encodes a non-functional α subunit that comprises 50% of the transcripts in normal human skeletal muscle, but its functional significance remains undetermined. In an effort to search for a potential therapy, we screened off-label effects of 960 bioactive chemical compounds and found that tannic acid ameliorates the aberrant splicing due to IVS3-8G>A but without altering the expression of hnRNP H. Therefore, we searched for another splicing trans-factor. We found that the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) binds close to the 3′ end of CHRNA1 intron 3, that PTB induces skipping of exon P3A and that tannic acid increases the expression of PTB in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion assays of the PTB promoter region revealed that the tannic acid-responsive element is between positions −232 and −74 from the translation initiation site. These observations open the door to the discovery of novel therapies based on PTB overexpression and to detecting possible untoward effects of the overexpression.","genetics"

"Rabies is a zoonotic disease and stray dogs, wild carnivores and bats are the natural reservoirs of rabies. Oral immunization with live vaccines is the only practical approach to eradicate rabies in free ranging terrestrial animals. We have developed the double glycoprotein (G) rabies virus (RV) variant SPBNGAS‐GAS that has great promise to be used as a live‐attenuated vaccine. Oral immunization of rodents and several target animal species with this double G RV variant resulted in the induction of protective immunity, superior to that induced by a single RV G variant (SPBNGAS). The high oral efficacy of SPBNGAS‐GAS is likely because of its increased ability to infect monocytes or immature dendritic cells (DCs), thereby inducing their conversion into mature DCs. Furthermore, infection of DCs with the double G variant resulted in a strong up‐regulation of the expression of genes related to the NFκB signalling pathway including IFN‐α and IFN‐β, which might underlie the protection conferred by this live RV vaccine. A potential problem associated with the use of live RVs for oral vaccination could rest in the possibility of reversion to the pathogenic phenotype because of the high mutation rate characteristic for all RNA viruses. In this respect, the presence of a second non‐pathogenic G gene decreases considerably the risk of reversion to the pathogenic phenotype because a non‐pathogenic G is dominant over a pathogenic G in determining the pathogenicity of the double G RV variant. Because of its excellent efficacy and safety, the SPBNGAS‐GAS vaccine may provide a distinct advantage over other live RV vaccine in its ability to vaccinate a broad range of mammalian species.","veterinary"
"Electroosmotic flow with solution displacement in microchannels is often encountered in many lab-on-a-chip devices where washing procedures are designed using one solution to displace another different solution. In order to investigate the detailed flow structures for a displacement process between two different electrolyte solutions, a three-dimensional numerical model is developed in this paper. KCl solution and LaCl3 solution are used as sample solutions. A 2 mm long straight microchannel with a rectangular cross-sectional area (height 100 m and width 200 m) was employed in this study. The governing equations of the applied electrical field, flow field and concentration field are numerically solved based on a finite-control-volume scheme. The fluid flow coupled equations are solved using the semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equation (SIMPLE) algorithm. The observed electrokinetic flow structures include back flow in the center of the channel and distortion of the plug-like electroosmotic velocity profile, which are investigated in detail. It is found that distortion in the flow field is due to the induced pressure gradient, which results from the nonuniformity of electroosmotic mobilities and electrical conductivities of the two solutions. Finally, the displacement between a pair of different solutions, distilled ultra-filtered (DIUF) water and LaCl3 solution, is briefly studied.","nanoscience"
"Objectives: Evaluation of a wide variety of pyridine N-oxide derivatives on their inhibitory activity against feline coronavirus (FIPV strain) and human SARS-CoV (Frankfurt strain-1) in cell culture. Methods: FIPV and SARS-CoV were exposed to confluent Crandel feline kidney (CRFK) and simian kidney (Vero) cell cultures in the presence of serial concentrations of the test compounds. The anti-cytopathic activity of the pyridine N-oxide derivatives was monitored by spectrophotometric analysis. Results and conclusions: A wide variety of pyridine N-oxide derivatives have been found to be inhibitory against feline coronavirus (FIPV strain) and human SARS-CoV (Frankfurt strain-1) in CRFK and simian kidney (Vero) cell cultures, respectively. The oxide part on the pyridine moiety proved indispensable for anti-coronavirus activity. The potency and virus specificity of the pyridine N-oxide derivatives varied depending the nature and specific location of substituents (i.e. alkyl, halogeno, nitro, etc.) on the different parts of the molecule. The most selective compounds were active in the higher microgram per litre range, being non-toxic at 50–100 mg/L.

"Novel DNA sequencing technologies with the potential for up to three orders magnitude more sequence throughput than conventional Sanger sequencing are emerging. The instrument now available from Solexa Ltd, produces millions of short DNA sequences of 25 nt each.

However, given the sequencing depth and the throughput of this instrument, stringent assembly of highly identical sequences can be achieved.

"Abstract  Abstract  Recently developed control measure modeling approaches for containing airborne infections, including engineering controls with respiratory protection and public health interventions, are readily amenable to an integrated‐scale analysis. Here we show that such models can be derived from an integrated‐scale analysis generated from three different types of functional relationship: Wells–Riley mathematical model, competing‐risks model, and Von Foerster equation, both of the key epidemiological determinants involved and of the functional connections between them. We examine mathematically the impact of engineering control measures such as enhanced air exchange and air filtration rates with personal masking combined with public health interventions such as vaccination, isolation, and contact tracing in containing the spread of indoor airborne infections including influenza, chickenpox, measles, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). If enhanced engineering controls could reduce the basic reproductive number (R0) below 1.60 for chickenpox and 3 for measles, our simulations show that in such a prepared response with public health interventions would have a high probability of containing the indoor airborne infections. Combinations of engineering control measures and public health interventions could moderately contain influenza strains with an R0 as high as 4. Our analysis indicates that effective isolation of symptomatic patients with low‐efficacy contact tracing is sufficient to control a SARS outbreak. We suggest that a valuable added dimension to public health inventions could be provided by systematically quantifying transmissibility and proportion of asymptomatic infection of indoor airborne infection.","public"

Dynamic mathematical models have suggested that SARS, if uncontrolled, would infect the majority of people wherever it was introduced [3–5]. The patterns of spread suggest droplet or contact transmission [6]. Close proximity of persons enhances the risk of transmission, and this together with handling of human secretions (respiratory secretions, faeces, etc.) have made the hospital setting particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of SARS.","public"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) struck Hong Kong bitterly in the spring of 2003, infecting 1755 persons and claiming nearly 300 lives. The epidemic was introduced by travellers from southern China, where the disease had originated. It started in late February and lasted until early June. Two notable ‘super-spreading’ events were reported, one inside a teaching hospital and the other in a private housing estate. Other than in the super-spreading events, the infectivity in the community appeared to be low, and there were few, if any, asymptomatic or subclinical infections. Health-care workers were at particular risk and accounted for 22% of all probable cases. The main modes of transmission were through droplet spread and close/direct contacts, but situations conducive to aerosol generation appeared to be associated with higher risk. Our review suggests that there are still many unknown factors concerning the mode of transmission and environmental risk that need to be clarified.","public"
"Although oligonucleotide probes complementary to single nucleotide substitutions are commonly used in microarray-based screens for genetic variation, little is known about the hybridization properties of probes complementary to small insertions and deletions. It is necessary to define the hybridization properties of these latter probes in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of disease-related genes. Here, we compare and contrast the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of 25mer probes complementary to all possible single nucleotide substitutions and insertions, and one and two base deletions in the 9168 bp coding region of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene. Over 68 different dye-labeled single-stranded nucleic acid targets representing all ATM coding exons were applied to these microarrays. We assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to ATM sequences to those containing mismatches. Probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions, single base deletions and single base insertions. In all the cases, hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra- and intermolecular probe and/or target structure. Furthermore, single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions, two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions. Overall, these studies provide valuable empirical data that can be used to more accurately model the hybridization properties of insertion and deletion probes and improve the design and interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray-based resequencing and mutational analysis.","biochemistry"
"RNA viruses replicate as complex and dynamic mutant distributions. They are termed viral quasispecies, in recognition of the fundamental contribution of quasispecies theory in our understanding of error-prone replicative entities. Viral quasispecies have launched a fertile field of transdiciplinary research, both experimental and theoretical. Here we review the origin and some implications of the quasispecies concept, with emphasis on internal interactions among components of the same mutant virus ensemble, a critical fact to design new antiviral strategies. We make the distinction between “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” properties of mutant distributions, and emphasize that there are several levels of complexity that can influence viral quasispecies behavior.","multidisciplinary"
"L’agent infectieux responsable de la transmission du SRAS (syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère) est un coronavirus. Ces virus ont fait l’objet d’une abondante littérature, surtout du fait des maladies qu’ils induisent dans certaines espèces animales d’élevage et des problèmes socio-économiques qui en découlent. Chez l’homme, les deux souches de coronavirus prototypes, nommées 229 E et OC43, sont responsables d’environ 30% des rhinites virales. Bien que ces maladies soient bénignes, certains auteurs notaient, dès 1998, que «la capacité d’évolution et d’adaptation des coronavirus est importante et peut engendrer l’apparition de variants dont le pouvoir pathogène serait modifié en faveur du virus».

"Background. Human bocavirus is a newly discovered parvovirus. It has been detected primarily in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection, but its occurrence, clinical profile, and role as a causative agent of respiratory tract disease are not clear. Methods. We investigated the presence of human bocavirus by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens and selected serum samples obtained from 259 children (median age, 1.6 years) who had been hospitalized for acute expiratory wheezing. The samples were analyzed for 16 respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction, virus culture, antigen detection, and serological assays. Results. At least 1 potential etiologic agent was detected in 95% of children, and >1 agent was detected in 34% of children. Human bocavirus was detected in 49 children (19%). A large proportion of the cases were mixed infections with other viruses, but human bocavirus was the only virus detected in 12 children (5%). High viral loads of human bocavirus were noted mainly in the absence of other viral agents, suggesting a causative role for acute wheezing. In addition, infections that had uncertain clinical relevance and low viral loads were prevalent. Human bocavirus DNA was frequently detected in serum specimens obtained from patients with acute wheezing, suggesting systemic infection. Conclusions. Human bocavirus is prevalent among children with acute wheezing and can cause systemic infection. Results suggest a model for bocavirus infection in which high viral loads are potentially associated with respiratory symptoms and low viral loads indicate asymptomatic shedding. Therefore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis may be important for additional studies of human bocavirus.","microbiology"
"Many viruses are known to cause influenza‐like illness (ILI); however, in nearly 50% of patients, the etiologic agent remains unknown. The distribution of viruses in patients with ILI was investigated during the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic (A/H1N1p). From June 2009 to January 2010, 660 patients with suspected influenza were questioned and examined, and nasal swabs were collected. All patient samples were tested for influenza virus, and 286 negative nasal swabs were tested further for 18 other respiratory viruses using real‐time RT‐PCR. Two waves of ILI were observed in the epidemic curve (weeks 35–42 and 42–49). At least eight viruses co‐circulated during this period: human rhinovirus (HRV) (58), parainfluenza 1–4 viruses (PIV) (9), human Coronavirus (hCoV) OC43 (9), enterovirus (5), adenovirus (AdV) (4), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (2); however, 204 samples remained negative for all viruses tested. ILI symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for ILI definition, were reported in 75% of cases. These patients had positive swabs for A/H1N1p, HRV, hCoV‐OC43, PIV, AdV, and hMPV without significant difference with non‐ILI patients. This study found that many respiratory viruses circulated during this period and that the A/H1N1p did not impact on the kinetics of other respiratory viruses. The proportion of non‐documented cases remains high. ILI could not distinguish A/H1N1p infection from that due to other respiratory viruses. However, in multivariate anlaysis, cough, chills, hyperemia, and dyspnea were associated significantly with influenza virus versus other respiratory viruses. J. Med.

"RNA interference (RNAi)‐based short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the viral genes and the host cellular genes have been used to suppress Measles virus (MV) replication in vitro. In order to select suitable target genes and highly effective target sites for developing effective RNAi‐mediated anti‐MV therapy, in this study, nine short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors, which expressed siRNAs targeting the host celluar Rab9 GTPase gene, the viral large protein (L) gene and nucleoprotein (N) gene, respectively, were constructed and used to compare their ability to inhibit MV replication in Vero‐E6 cells. The results showed that nine siRNAs targeting different genes exhibited different inhibitory efficacy on MV replication in vitro (about 23–94%), which could last at least 168 h post‐infection. Of the nine siRNAs, R2, L1 and N2 more effectively decreased MV replication by over 90%. Furthermore, inhibitory efficacy on MV replication were increased and reached almost 100% when cells were transfected with pR2, pL1 and pN2 together. These results emphasis the importance of selecting suitable siRNA target sites for developing siRNAs‐based drug therapy for MV, and demonstrate the potential of combination of siRNAs targeting different genes as a therapeutic approach to treat MV infection.

"Hepatitis B virus (HBV)‐encoded X protein (HBx protein) is a multi‐functional regulatory protein. It functions by protein–protein interaction and plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HBV‐related diseases. However, the partners in hepatocytes interacting with HBx protein are far from understood fully. In this study, immunoprecipitation was employed to screen for binding partners for the HBx protein from huh‐7 hepatoma cells infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing HBx protein, and five cellular proteins including eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1), were identified. The interaction between HBx protein and eEF1A1 was confirmed further using a GST pull‐down assay and co‐immunoprecipitation, respectively. In Huh‐7 hepatoma cells, the HBx protein inhibits dimer formation of eEF1A1, hence blocks filamentous actin bundling. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in the functions of the HBx protein. J. Med. Virol. 84:871–877, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","virology"
"La plupart des virus utilisent la machinerie de traduction dépendante de la coiffe pour assurer l’expression de leurs ARN messagers (ARNm). L’addition d’une structure coiffe à l’extrémité 5’ des ARNm viraux est par conséquent une étape essentielle pour la réplication de nombreux virus. En effet, la coiffe protège les ARNm de la dégradation par les nucléases cellulaires et neutralise la détection des ARNm viraux par les mécanismes de l’immunité innée. L’acquisition de la coiffe des ARN viraux se fait soit en utilisant les enzymes cellulaires de formation de la coiffe de la cellule infectée ou en subtilisant la coiffe des ARNm de la cellule infectée, soit par des machineries enzymatiques virales dédiées. De nombreuses enzymes virales impliquées dans la synthèse de la coiffe ont récemment été caractérisées du point de vue structural et fonctionnel. Ces études ont révélé des mécanismes de synthèse originaux qui ouvrent la voie pour le développement d’inhibiteurs spécifiques à potentiel antiviral.","medicine"
"En juillet 2003, plus de 8000 cas de SRAS avaient ete rapportes a l’OMS sans que l’on sache comment et pourquoi cette affection avait diffuse en Asie et dans le reste du monde. On ignorait en particulier la duree d’incubation du SRAS, et le nombre de sujets contamines par un malade semblait varier beaucoup selon les situations. On ne savait pas non plus comment la maladie allait se propager. Les modeles mathematiques pouvaient apporter des elements de reponse a ces questions. Deux etudes publiees sur le SRAS ont utilise des modeles de type stochastique (prenant en compte les phenomenes aleatoires) et deterministe (traçant une trajectoire unique de l’epidemie pour un jeu de parametres et de conditions initiales fixes). Ils ont permis d’estimer que le taux de reproduction de base, ou nombre de cas secondaires pour un individu contagieux lorsque l’ensemble de la population est susceptible a l’agent viral, serait pour le SRAS compris entre 2 et 4 (voisin, mais plutot plus faible, que celui de la grippe, et bien inferieur a celui de la rougeole ou de la rubeole). Ces travaux suggerent cependant que le potentiel epidemique (voire pandemique) du SRAS pourrait etre redoutable en l’absence de mesures de prevention, et que celles qui ont vise a freiner sa transmission au printemps 2003 en limitant les contacts ont pu expliquer le controle efficace de l’epidemie. Si ces etudes aident a mieux comprendre et a reconstituer la transmission du SRAS a Hong Kong et Singapour, et contribuent a l’evaluation des mesures de maitrise du risque prises au niveau international, aucun des modeles proposes ne permet encore de prevoir le devenir de cette maladie emergente.","medicine"

"Fungi and viruses encode a variety of peptidases having a plethora of functions. Many fungal peptidases are extracellular and are likely used to degrade proteins in their environment. Viral peptidases are processing enzymes, intimately involved in the virus infectious cycle. The viral RNA genome is translated by the host-cell machinery into a large polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral peptidases into mature capsid proteins, non-structural proteins and enzymes. I review the structure and catalytic mechanism of scytalidoglutamic peptidase isolated from the wood-destroying fungus Scytalidium lignicolum. This enzyme has a unique β-sandwich fold and a novel catalytic mechanism based on a glutamate, a glutamine and a nucleophilic water molecule. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C peptidase was the first structure identified for a viral 3C enzyme that exhibited the three-dimensional fold of the chymotrypsin family of serine peptidases but had a cysteine sulfur atom instead of the serine oxygen as the nucleophile. The structure of HAV 3C was unusual in that the Asp residue expected as the third member of the catalytic triad did not interact with the general base His. The present structure is of a β-lactone-inhibited version of HAV 3C that has a restored catalytic triad.","biochemistry"

"The severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is reported to have deletions of various sizes. Recently, the large 386-nucleotide deletion (L386del) comprising nucleotide positions 27719-28104 and spanning open reading frames 9–11 has been reported in the genomes of some human isolates from Hong Kong. In this study, archived specimens from 71 patients with SARS who were admitted to the New Territory East Cluster Hospitals in Hong Kong were analyzed to determine whether the L386del variant of SARS-CoV was present. There was no clear relationship between the presence of the L386del variant and SARS clinical severity as defined either by the need for intensive-care therapy and/or ventilation or by death. One patient had evidence of both the L386del variant and the wild-type variant in the same clinical specimen, supporting the idea that SARS-CoV exists as a quasispecies in some patients, although the clinical significance of these quasispecies remains unclear","microbiology"
"Background. Most documented “superspreading events” of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in hospitals, but the underlying causes remain unclear. We systematically analyzed the risk factors for nosocomial outbreaks of SARS among hospital wards in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, China. Methods. A case-control study was conducted. Case wards were hospital wards in which superspreading events of SARS occurred, and control wards were wards in which patients with SARS were admitted, but no subsequent nosocomial outbreaks occurred. Information on environmental and administrative factors was obtained through visits to the wards and interviews with ward managers or nursing officers. Relevant information about host factors was abstracted from the medical records. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify the major risk factors for superspreading events. Results. Eighty-six wards in 21 hospitals in Guangzhou and 38 wards in 5 hospitals in Hong Kong were included in the study. Six risk factors were significant in the final multiple-logistic regression model: minimum distance between beds of ≤1 m (odds ratio [OR], 6.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68–28.75), availability of washing or changing facilities for staff (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02–0.97), whether resuscitation was ever performed in the ward (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.04–13.87), whether staff members worked while experiencing symptoms (OR, 10.55; 95% CI, 2.28–48.87), whether any host patients (index patient or the first patient with SARS admitted to a ward) required oxygen therapy (OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.00–18.43), and whether any host patients required bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (OR, 11.82; 95% CI, 1.97–70.80). Conclusions. Our results revealed that factors that were associated with the ward environment and administration were important in nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. The lessons learned from this study remain very important and highly relevant to the daily operation of hospital wards if we are to prevent nosocomial outbreaks of other respiratory infections in the future.","microbiology"
"So far, most monoclonal antibodies have been developed for treating cancer or immunological diseases. However, the global spread of infections such as West Nile and corona viruses, and the need to address the potential threat of bioterrorism, has boosted public interest in, and government support of, counter-measures for infectious diseases. The attractive features of monoclonal antibodies, such as high specificity and effective recruitment of the immune system, would seem to make them excellent candidates as anti-infective agents. Here, we analyse trends in the development and approval of anti-infective monoclonal antibodies, and discuss factors that influence their success.","pharmacology"
"In a group of N individuals, carrying an infection with prevalence π, the exact probability P of failing in detecting the infection is evaluated when a diagnostic test of sensitivity s and specificity s′ is carried out on a sample of n individuals extracted without replacement from the group. Furthermore, the minimal number of individuals that must be tested if the probability P has to be lower than a fixed value is determined as a function of π. If all n tests result negative, confidence intervals for π are given both in the frequentistic and Bayesian approach. These results are applied to recent data for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The conclusion is that entry screening with a diagnostic test is rarely an efficacious tool for preventing importation of a disease into a country. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","public"

It is extraordinary how little Darwinism and post-Darwinian evolutionary science has penetrated medicine despite the fact that all biology is built upon its foundations.

"SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes a main protease, 3CLpro, which plays an essential role in the viral life cycle and is currently the prime target for discovering new anti-coronavirus agents. In this article, we report our success in developing a novel red-shifted (RS) fluorescence-based assay for 3CLpro and its application for identifying small-molecule anti-SARS agents from marine organisms. We have synthesised and characterised the first generation of a red-shifted internally quenched fluorogenic substrate (RS-IQFS) for 3CLpro based on resonance energy transfer between the donor and acceptor pair CAL Fluor Red 610 and Black Hole Quencher-1 (K m and k cat values of 14 μM and 0.65 min-1). The RS-IQFS primary sequence was selected based on the results of our screening analysis of 3CLpro performed using a series of blue-shifted (BS)-IQFSs corresponding to the 3CLpro-mediated cleavage junctions of the SARS-CoV polyproteins. In contrast to BS-IQFSs, the RS-IQFS was not susceptible to fluorescence interference from coloured samples and allowed for successful screening of marine natural products and identification of a coumarin derivative, esculetin-4-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, a novel 3CLpro inhibitor (IC50=46 μM) and anti-SARS agent (EC50=112 μM; median toxic concentration >800 μM) from the tropical marine sponge Axinella corrugata.","biochemistry"
"Objective: To determine, using the perspective of a hospital-based palliative care service (PCS), the spiritual and psychosocial impact of a novel and potentially fatal viral epidemic on patients, their families and health care workers. Design: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using the constant comparative method and were validated using respondent validation. Participants: Eight palliative care workers. Setting: Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), the hospital designated to manage all cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore. Results: Disease containment resulted in isolation, where isolation meant the disruption of connectedness. This disruption of connectedness took place at multiple levels: in the patient himself, between the patient and the family, within the family, between the patient and the health care worker, between the patient and society, and between health care workers. As the nature of the disease was uncertain, prognostication was inaccurate. This created difficulties in helping patients and their families prepare for death. The fear of facing the unknown led to safety-seeking behaviours, which could be overcome by repeated exposure to the feared situation. The process of bereavement was disturbed, as traditional death rituals could not be performed by the family. Informants perceived themselves to be suffering as they suffered the same anxieties, fears and grief as the patient. Conclusions: Dealing with a novel viral epidemic creates spiritual and psychosocial issues similar to those encountered in a palliative care practice. Palliative care workers would do well to be aware of such issues and act proactively when such epidemics arise.","public"
"Global biosecurity threats such as the spread of emerging infectious diseases (i.e., avian influenza, SARS, Hendra, Nipah, etc.) and bioterrorism have generated significant interest in recent years. There is considerable effort directed towards understanding and negating the proliferation of infectious diseases. Biosensors are an attractive tool which have the potential to detect the outbreak of a virus and/or disease. Although there is a host of technologies available, either commercially or in the scientific literature, the development of biosensors for the detection of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) is still in its infancy. There is no doubt that the glucose biosensor, the gene chip, the protein chip, etc. have all played and are still playing a significant role in monitoring various biomolecules. Can biosensors play an important role for the detection of emerging infectious diseases?

"Anthrax lethal factor (LF) is a key virulence factor of anthrax lethal toxin. We screened a chemolibrary of 10 000 drug-like molecules for their ability to inhibit LF and identified 18 novel small molecules with potent LF inhibitory activity. Three additional LF inhibitors were identified through further structure−activity relationship (SAR) analysis. All 21 compounds inhibited LF with an IC50 range of 0.8 to 11 μM, utilizing mixed-mode competitive inhibition. An evaluation of inhibitory activity against a range of unrelated proteases showed relatively high specificity for LF. Furthermore, pharmacophore modeling of these compounds showed a high degree of similarity to the model published by Panchal et al. (Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004, 11, 67−72), indicating that the conformational features of these inhibitors are structurally compatible with the steric constraints of the substrate-binding pocket. These novel LF inhibitors and the structural scaffolds identified as important for inhibitory activity represent promising leads to pursue for further LF inhibitor development.","chemistry"
"This work demonstrated the feasibility of detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using microcantilever technology by showing that the feline coronavirus (FIP) type I virus can be detected by a microcantilever modified by feline coronavirus (FIP) type I anti-viral antiserum. A microcantilever modified by FIP type I anti-viral antiserum was developed for the detection of FIP type I virus. When the FIP type I virus positive sample is injected into the fluid cell where the microcantilever is held, the microcantilever bends upon the recognition of the FIP type I virus by the antiserum on the surface of the microcantilever. A negative control sample that does not contain FIP type I virus did not cause any bending of the microcantilever. The detection limit of the sensor was 0.1 g ml1 when the assay time was <1 h.","instruments"
"Background: Influenza-like illness (ILI) among elderly people living in residential care homes (RCHEs) is a common cause for hospitalisation. A study was undertaken to examine the incidence, underlying aetiology, natural history and associated healthcare resource utilisation related to ILI in the RCHE population. Methods: A prospective study of ILI in four RCHEs in Shatin, Hong Kong was conducted from April 2006 to March 2007. Each RCHE was monitored daily for the occurrence of ILI and followed up until resolution of illness or death. Clinical features were recorded and sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, blood and urine specimens were examined for underlying aetiology. Results: 259 episodes of ILI occurred in 194 subjects, with mild peaks in winter and summer, over a sustained level throughout the year. The infectious agent was identified in 61.4% of all episodes, comprising bacterial infection in 53.3% and viral in 46.7%. Multiple infections occurred in 16.2% of subjects. The most frequent organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. Clinical features did not vary according to the underlying aetiology, the common presenting features being a decrease in general condition, cognitive and functional deterioration, and withholding of food in addition to fever and respiratory symptoms. Overall, mortality at 1 month/discharge was 9.7%. Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, low body mass index and poor function predisposed to mortality. No association was observed between influenza vaccination status and underlying aetiology, clinical features or outcome. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of ILI is non-specific and is mainly due to bacterial and viral infections other than influenza in the RCHE population.","respiratory"
"Motivation: The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has necessitated an in-depth molecular understanding of the virus to identify new drug targets. The availability of complete genome sequence of several strains of SARS virus provides the possibility of identification of protein-coding genes and defining their functions. Computational approach to identify protein-coding genes and their putative functions will help in designing experimental protocols. Results: In this paper, a novel analysis of SARS genome using gene prediction method GeneDecipher developed in our laboratory has been presented. Each of the 18 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes has been analyzed using GeneDecipher. In addition to polyprotein 1ab1, polyprotein 1a and the four genes coding for major structural proteins spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), six to eight additional proteins have been predicted depending upon the strain analyzed. Their lengths range between 61 and 274 amino acids. Our method also suggests that polyprotein 1ab, polyprotein 1a, S, M and N are proteins of viral origin and others are of prokaryotic. Putative functions of all predicted protein-coding genes have been suggested using conserved peptides present in their open reading frames.

"It has not been clarified if there is a correlation between rhinovirus (RV) load and disease severity in the lower respiratory tract infections of hospitalized children. This study was undertaken to elucidate the contribution of the viral load to the development of disease severity in 412 children ≤3 years of age who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections. The RV load in nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from the patients at the time of admission was measured by real‐time quantitative reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the clinical symptoms of the patients were assessed using a severity scoring system. Of the 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) were diagnosed with RV infections only, and 15 were determined to have high severity scores. When all patients infected with RV were assessed, there was no correlation between the viral load and the disease severity. However, there was a significant negative correlation between the disease severity and age among children <11 months of age (n = 15, ρ = −0.677, P = 0.006) and a significant positive correlation between the viral load and the disease severity among children ≥11 months of age (n = 28, ρ = 0.407, P = 0.032). Among the patients infected with RV <11 months of age, the disease severity may be associated with an immature immune response and the small diameter of their airways rather than viral load. By contrast, in the patients ≥11 months of age, viral load may contribute to the development of disease severity. J. Med. Virol. 84: 1135–1142, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","virology"
"Viruses depend on cells for their replication but have evolved mechanisms to achieve this in an efficient and, in some instances, a cell‐type‐specific manner. The expression of viral proteins is frequently subject to translational control. The dominant target of such control is the initiation step of protein synthesis. Indeed, during the early stages of infection, viral mRNAs must compete with their host counterparts for the protein synthetic machinery, especially for the limited pool of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) that mediate the recruitment of ribosomes to both viral and cellular mRNAs. To circumvent this competition viruses use diverse strategies so that ribosomes can be recruited selectively to viral mRNAs. In this review we focus on the initiation of protein synthesis and outline some of the strategies used by viruses to ensure efficient translation initiation of their mRNAs.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infectious disease with a significant morbidity and mortality. The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache, and dyspnoea. Older subjects may present without the typical febrile response. Common laboratory features include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, raised alanine transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. The constellation of compatible clinical and laboratory findings, together with certain characteristic radiological features and lack of clinical response to broad spectrum antibiotics, should arouse suspicion of SARS. Measurement of serum RNA by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique has a detection rate of 75%–80% in the first week of the illness.","medicine"
"Objective  The recent worldwide epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Disease (SARS) caused over 800 deaths and had a major impact on the health services in affected communities. The impact of SARS on colorectal surgery, particularly service provision and training, is unknown. This paper reports these changes from a single colorectal unit at the centre of the outbreak. Patients and methods  Hospital databases and electronic patient records covering the 4 months duration of the SARS epidemic and an equivalent period preceding SARS were compared. Data was collected for inpatient admissions, outpatient consultations, operative surgery, colonoscopy and waiting times for appointments or surgery. Results  The SARS epidemic resulted in reductions of 52% for new outpatient attendances, 59% for review attendances, 51% for admissions, 32% for surgical procedures and 48% for colonoscopies. Major emergency procedures, cancer resections and complex major procedures were unaffected. Operative procedures by trainees reduced by 48% and procedures by specialists reduced by 21%. Patients awaiting early or urgent outpatient appointments rose by 200% with waiting times for colonoscopy increased by a median 3, 5 or 9 weeks for outpatient, inpatient or non‐urgent cases, respectively. The waiting time for minor elective colorectal surgery was extended by 5 months. Conclusion  SARS resulted in a major reduction in the colorectal surgical caseload. The consequences were evidenced by a detrimental effect on waiting times and colorectal training. However, serious pathology requiring emergency or complex surgery was still possible within these constraints.","surgery"
"The incubation period of SARS is the time between infection of disease and onset of symptoms. Knowledge about the distribution of incubation times is crucial in determining the length of quarantine period and is an important parameter in modelling the spread and control of SARS. As the exact time of infection is unknown for most patients, the incubation time cannot be determined. What is observable is the serial interval which is the time from the onset of symptoms in an index case to the onset of symptoms in a subsequent case infected by the index case. By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution which is assumed to be Weibull, and justifications are given to support this choice over other distributions. The method is applied to data provided by the Ministry of Health of Singapore and the results justify the choice of a ten‐day quarantine period. The indirect estimate obtained using the method of convolution likelihood is validated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Despite its name, the proposed indirect estimate is actually more precise than the direct estimate because serial interval data are recorded for almost all patients, whereas exact incubation times can be determined for only a small subset. It is possible to obtain an even more efficient estimate by using the combined data but the improvement is not substantial. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","public"
"Les virus à ARN sont responsables de maladies graves telles que la grippe, la dengue, l’hépatite C, la rougeole ou la bronchiolite des nourrissons. Ils représentent également une menace émergente en raison des échanges internationaux et des bouleversements écologiques liés aux activités humaines. Notre compréhension des mécanismes cellulaires qui contrôlent la réplication virale a fortement progressé ces dernières années, et il apparaît que des composés capables de cibler la cellule hôte, plutôt que le virus lui-même, pourraient inhiber un large éventail de virus à ARN. Ainsi, différents laboratoires privés et universitaires sont en quête de molécules stimulant la réponse antivirale innée des cellules hôtes. Une stratégie intéressante consiste à rechercher des molécules induisant l’expression des ISG (interferon-stimulated genes), lesquels constituent un vaste ensemble de gènes antiviraux activés en particulier par les interférons de type I. Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous avons mis au point un test phénotypique basé sur des cellules humaines transfectées avec un gène rapporteur luciférase sous contrôle d’un élément de réponse aux interférons (ISRE). Ce système a été utilisé pour cribler une chimiothèque d’environ 54 000 composés. Parmi les molécules sélectionnées, nous avons montré que le composé DD264 stimule la réponse immunitaire innée dans les cultures cellulaires, et présente une activité antivirale à large spectre. En recherchant la cible de ce composé, nous avons montré qu’il inhibe la voie de biosynthèse de novo des pyrimidines, et notamment la quatrième enzyme de cette voie métabolique, la dihydroorotate déshydrogénase (DHODH). Ainsi, nos résultats établissent de façon surprenante un lien fonctionnel nouveau entre la voie de biosynthèse des pyrimidines et la réponse innée antivirale.","medicine"

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in February 2003. It is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Healthcare workers in affected countries were exposed to the regular use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as the N95 mask, gloves, and gowns. Our aim was to study the prevalence of adverse skin reactions to PPE among healthcare workers in Singapore during the SARS outbreak. Healthcare staff in the National Skin Centre and Tan Tock Seng Hospital were surveyed using questionnaires. Of those asked to participate, 322 (94.7%) agreed. 14.3% of the respondents were doctors, 73.0% nurses, and 12.7% other ancillary staff. Mean age of respondents was 32.4 years, with the majority being women (85.7%) and Chinese (53.7%). 109 (35.5%) of the 307 staff who used masks regularly reported acne (59.6%), facial itch (51.4%), and rash (35.8%) from N95 mask use. 64 (21.4%) of the 299 who used gloves regularly reported dry skin (73.4%), itch (56.3%), and rash (37.5%). The use of PPE is associated with high rates of adverse skin reactions. There is a need to find suitable alternatives for affected staff and to encourage awareness among staff of the role of dermatologists in their care.","dermatology"
"An efficient mechanism for the sequence‐specific inhibition of gene expression is RNA interference. In this process, double‐stranded RNA molecules induce cleavage of a selected target RNA (see picture). This technique has in recent years developed into a standard method of molecular biology. Successful applications in animal models have already led to the initiation of RNAi‐based clinical trials as a new therapeutic option. Only ten years ago Andrew Fire and Craig Mello were able to show that double‐stranded RNA molecules could inhibit the expression of homologous genes in eukaryotes. This process, termed RNA interference, has developed into a standard method of molecular biology. This Review provides an overview of the molecular processes involved, with a particular focus on the posttranscriptional inhibition of gene expression in mammalian cells, the possible applications in research, and the results of the first clinical studies.","chemistry"
"BackgroundGenetic determinants of susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection remain unknown. We assessed whether mannose-binding lectin (MBL) gene polymorphisms were associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection or disease severity in an ethnically homogeneous population born in northern China MethodsThe frequencies of 1 mutation in codon 54 and 3 promoter polymorphisms at nt −550, −221, and 4 were ascertained in 352 patients with SARS and 392 control subjects, by means of polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing ResultsOf 352 patients with SARS and 392 control subjects, 120 (34.4%) and 91 (23.2%) were carriers of the codon 54 variant, respectively (odds ratio [OR], 1.73 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.25–2.39]; P=.00086). A total of 123 (36.0%) of 352 patients with SARS and 100 (25.5%) of 392 control subjects had haplotype pairs associated with medium or low expression of MBL (OR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.21–2.29]; P=.00187). The population-attributable fraction of patients with SARS that was associated with having the codon 54 variant was 20.1% (95% CI, 7.9%–32.3%) ConclusionsMBL gene polymorphisms were significantly associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection; this might be explained by the reduced expression of functional MBL secondary to having the codon 54 variant","microbiology"
"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 triggered concerns regarding the ability of buildings to resist disease transmission. In particular, the outbreak that occurred in the high-rise residential blocks in the Amoy Gardens housing estate, sounded an alarm to the local practice of design, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of building services systems. Virus transmission through the vertical drainage stack is believed to have been one of the causes of disease transmission in Amoy Gardens. In this paper, the authors share their experiences and research findings on the building drainage system. The paper includes a review of the outbreak incident in Amoy Gardens; and of the observations and site measurements of foul air and water back flow in the drainage system of another vacant high-rise residential housing estate. In addition, tracer gas measurements were studied in order to verify the upwards flow of air in the vertical stack. These field studies allow comparisons between the gas flow from the drainage system to the living accommodation, and confirm the hypothesized infection route. Finally, the authors make recommendations on the proper design and operation of high-rise building drainage systems. Practical application: Sanitary drainage systems form a critical engineering component in maintaining hygienic conditions in buildings. In fact the issue has been addressed over several hundreds of years, for example during the Black Death outbreak worldwide. Despite this, the SARS outbreak demonstrates that there is still room for improvement on the safety of soil waste disposal in buildings. The findings in this paper shed light on the understanding of the outbreak in Hong Kong, and on the critical aspects to avoid performance failure in soil waste disposal.","construction"

"This paper analyzes data arising from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 involving 1755 cases. A discrete time stochastic model that uses a back‐projection approach is proposed. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are developed for estimation of model parameters. The algorithm is further extended to integrate numerically over unobserved variables of the model. Applying the method to SARS data from Hong Kong, a value of 3.88 with a posterior standard deviation of 0.09 was estimated for the basic reproduction number. An estimate of the transmission parameter at the beginning of the epidemic was also obtained as 0.149 with a posterior standard deviation of 0.003. A reduction in the transmission parameter during the course of the epidemic forced the effective reproduction number to cross the threshold value of one, seven days after control interventions were introduced. At the end of the epidemic, the effective reproduction number was as low as 0.001 suggesting that the epidemic was brought under control by the intervention measures introduced.

"Zoonoses, diseases that can spread under natural conditions between humans and other animals, are become a major public health concern in many countries including Canada. In Canada, investigations of zoonotic disease incidents are often conducted by public health inspectors (PHIs). However, little is known about PHIs' knowledge of transmission of zoonotic pathogens, their perceptions of zoonotic disease importance or their education regarding zoonotic diseases. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the knowledge, perceptions and education of Canadian PHIs regarding zoonotic diseases. Data were collected from December 2008–January 2009 using an internet‐based survey distributed to members of the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors national listserv. Responses were received from 229 PHIs in four provinces, with a response rate of approximately 20%. The majority of respondents reported at least 10 years of experience in the public health sector, 80% (181/225) were in frontline positions, and 62% (137/222) were routinely involved in investigations of infectious diseases. Two‐thirds believed that the importance of zoonotic diseases with regards to public health would increase in the next 5 years. Whilst most respondents were able to correctly identify animals capable of directly transmitting common zoonotic pathogens, there were gaps in knowledge, particularly with regard to rabies and transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens by companion animals. PHIs tended to feel that their training on zoonotic diseases prior to working as PHIs was deficient in some areas, or left some room for improvement. Their responses also suggested that there is a need for improvement in both the quantity and the quality of continuing education on zoonotic diseases. In particular, less than one‐third of PHIs received ongoing continuing education regarding zoonotic diseases, and of those that did, nearly two‐thirds rated the quantity and quality as only fair.","veterinary"

"Motivation: Immunological bioinformatics methods are applicable to a broad range of scientific areas. The specifics of how and where they might be implemented have recently been reviewed in the literature. However, the background and concerns for selecting between the different available methods have so far not been adequately covered. Summary: Before using predictions systems, it is necessary to not only understand how the methods are constructed but also their strength and limitations. The prediction systems in humoral epitope discovery are still in their infancy, but have reached a reasonable level of predictive strength. In cellular immunology, MHC class I binding predictions are now very strong and cover most of the known HLA specificities. These systems work well for epitope discovery, and predictions of the MHC class I pathway have been further improved by integration with state-of-the-art prediction tools for proteasomal cleavage and TAP binding. By comparison, class II MHC binding predictions have not developed to a comparable accuracy level, but new tools have emerged that deliver significantly improved predictions not only in terms of accuracy, but also in MHC specificity coverage. Simulation systems and mathematical modeling are also now beginning to reach a level where these methods will be able to answer more complex immunological questions.

"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is pivotal to innate and adaptive immune responses and must be tightly controlled. The mechanisms of TLR signaling have been the focus of extensive studies. Here we report that the tripartite-motif protein TRIM30α, a RING protein, was induced by TLR agonists and interacted with the TAB2-TAB3-TAK1 adaptor-kinase complex involved in the activation of transcription factor NF-κB. TRIM30α promoted the degradation of TAB2 and TAB3 and inhibited NF-κB activation induced by TLR signaling. In vivo studies showed that transfected or transgenic mice overexpressing TRIM30α were more resistant to endotoxic shock. Consistent with that, in vivo 'knockdown' of TRIM30α mRNA by small interfering RNA impaired lipopolysaccharide-induced tolerance. Finally, expression of TRIM30α depended on NF-κB activation. Our results collectively indicate that TRIM30α negatively regulates TLR-mediated NF-κB activation by targeting degradation of TAB2 and TAB3 by a 'feedback' mechanism.","immunology"
"Influenza virus remains a serious health threat, owing to its ability to evade immune surveillance through rapid genetic drift and reassortment. Here we used a human non-immune antibody phage-display library and the H5 hemagglutinin ectodomain to select ten neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that were effective against all group 1 influenza viruses tested, including H5N1 'bird flu' and the H1N1 'Spanish flu'. The crystal structure of one such nAb bound to H5 shows that it blocks infection by inserting its heavy chain into a conserved pocket in the stem region, thus preventing membrane fusion. Nine of the nAbs employ the germline gene VH1-69, and all seem to use the same neutralizing mechanism. Our data further suggest that this region is recalcitrant to neutralization escape and that nAb-based immunotherapy is a promising strategy for broad-spectrum protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.","cell"
"Sequencing pathogen genomes is costly, demanding careful allocation of limited sequencing resources. We built a computational Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP) to guide decisions regarding the amount of genomic sequencing necessary to develop high-quality diagnostic DNA and protein signatures. SAP uses simulations to estimate the number of target genomes and close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors or NNs) to sequence. We use SAP to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using Marburg and variola virus sequences. Simulations indicate that intermediate to high-quality draft with error rates of 10−3–10−5 (∼8× coverage) of target organisms is suitable for DNA signature prediction. Low-quality draft with error rates of ∼1% (3× to 6× coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, as long as the target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures.","biochemistry"
"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model system for studying innate immunity, including antiviral host defense. Infection with drosophila C virus triggers a transcriptional response that is dependent in part on the Jak kinase Hopscotch. Here we show that successful infection and killing of drosophila with the insect nodavirus flock house virus was strictly dependent on expression of the viral protein B2, a potent inhibitor of processing of double-stranded RNA mediated by the essential RNA interference factor Dicer. Conversely, flies with a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) showed enhanced susceptibility to infection by flock house virus, drosophila C virus and Sindbis virus, members of three different families of RNA viruses. These data demonstrate the importance of RNA interference for controlling virus replication in vivo and establish Dcr-2 as a host susceptibility locus for virus infections.","immunology"
"A combinatorial human Fab library was constructed using RNAs from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 6 rabies vaccine‐boosted volunteers using pComb3X phagemid vector. The size of the constructed library was approximately 7.0×107 Escherichia coli transformants. The library was selected against purified rabies virus (RV) virion or purified RV glycoprotein for isolation of phages displaying RV‐neutralizing human Fab antibody. Among 132 selected clones, two Fab preparations revealed neutralizing activities against RV strain CVS when assayed in the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). The Fab preparation EP5G3 exhibited neutralizing activity with an infected cell count reduction of 76% at a dilution of 1:2, and of 20% at a dilution of 1:4. The Fab preparation GD2D12 also exhibited neutralizing activity with a 57% reduction at 1:2 and 41% reduction at 1:4. In the co‐immunoprecipitation using strain CVS, the RV glycoprotein was precipitated in reactions with both Fab preparations. The RV neutralizing ability of the Fab preparations described in the study were not directly correlated with their binding specificity for RV antigens detected by ELISA.","microbiology"
"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus is an RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm, but the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein localizes specifically in the nucleus and nucleolus of virus-infected cells. Nuclear localization of N is non-essential for PRRSV replication in cultured cells but has been shown to modulate the pathogenesis of virus in pigs, suggesting that N plays an accessory role in the nucleus during infection. We identified by yeast two-hybrid screening the inhibitor of MyoD family-a (I-mfa) domain-containing protein (HIC) as a cellular partner for PRRS virus (PRRSV) N protein. This protein is a homolog of human HIC, a recently identified cellular transcription factor. The specific interaction of PRRSV N with HIC was confirmed in cells by mammalian two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro by GST pull-down assay. HIC is a zinc-binding protein and confocal microscopy demonstrated co-localization of N with the HIC-p40 isomer in the nucleus and nucleolus, and in the cytoplasm with HIC-p32, which is the N-terminal truncation of HIC-p40. The porcine homolog of HIC is universally expressed in pig tissues including alveolar macrophages. The interaction of viral capsid with the cellular transcription factor implicates a possible regulation of host cell gene expression by the N protein during PRRSV infection.","biochemistry"
"The purpose of our study was to examine the early expression of p21 and activated transcription factors ATF-2, CREB, Elk-1, p53 after soman and VX poisoning, to throw light on the pathogenetic mechanism of nerve agent-induced non-specific effects. Male Wistar rats were i.m. poisoned by soman (60 μg.kg-1 - 70% LD50) or VX (8 μg.kg-1 - 70% LD50). Samples were taken 4, 24, and 72 hours after poisoning, immunohistochemically stained and phospho-ATF-2Thr-69/71, phospho-CREBSer-133, phospho-Elk-1Ser-383, phospho-p53Ser-15, and protein p21 expressions were measured using computer Image analysis in apical and cryptal enterocytes of the colon transversum. After soman poisoning, we observed an increased phospho-CREB in cryptal enterocytes 4, 24, and 72 h after poisoning, while apical enterocytes expressed increased phospho-CREB only 72 h after intoxication. Phospho-Elk-1 significantly dropped 4 and 24 h after soman poisoning in the cryptal compartment. Activation of ATF-2 and p53 and expression of p21 were not changed 4, 24, and 72 h after soman poisoning. VX poisoning did not change any of measured parameters. Soman and VX showed a different effect on cellular signalling. Soman seems to cause additional effects, which are not related to the basic mechanism of nerve agent-induced toxicity and which temporarily suppress promitotic pathways of proliferating cells and persist in cells during the differentiation process.","pharmacology"
"Although often encoding fewer than a dozen genes, RNA viruses can overcome host antiviral responses and wreak havoc on the cells they infect. Some manage to evade host antiviral defences, whereas others elicit an aberrant or disproportional immune response. Both scenarios can result in the disruption of intracellular signalling pathways and significant pathology in the host. Systems-biology approaches are increasingly being used to study the processes of viral triggering and regulation of host immune responses. By providing a global and integrated view of cellular events, these approaches are beginning to unravel some of the complexities of virus–host interactions and provide new insights into how RNA viruses cause disease.","immunology"
"A combination of protein−ligand docking and ligand-based QSAR approaches has been elaborated, aiming to speed-up the process of virtual screening. In particular, this approach utilizes docking scores generated for already processed compounds to build predictive QSAR models that, in turn, assess hypothetical target binding affinities for yet undocked entries. The “progressive docking” has been tested on drug-like substances from the NCI database that have been docked into several unrelated targets, including human sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), carbonic anhydrase, corticosteroid-binding globulin, SARS 3C-like protease, and HIV1 reverse transcriptase. We demonstrate that progressive docking can reduce the amount of computations 1.2- to 2.6-fold (when compared to traditional docking), while maintaining 80−99% hit recovery rates. This progressive-docking procedure, therefore, substantially accelerates high throughput screening, especially when using high accuracy (slower) docking approaches and large-sized datasets, and has allowed us to identify several novel potent nonsteroidal SHBG ligands.","chemistry"
"Objectives: To investigate patterns of behaviours and attitudes related to SARS prevention in the Hong Kong cross border traveller population. Settings: A survey was carried out at the Hong Kong-China cross border checkpoint in the middle of the epidemic. Participants: A total of 839 Hong Kong adult residents returning to Hong Kong from mainland China were surveyed. Main outcome measures: Practice of preventive measures and relevant behaviours and attitudes. Results: Around 40% of the respondents were using masks all or most of the time in public places or washing their hands frequently (>10 times per day) and about one third avoided visiting crowded places in mainland China. Such figures were however lower than those practised by the general public in Hong Kong. SARS related perceptions, such as perceived risk of transmission and efficacy, etc, were associated with mask use and not visiting crowded places, but not with hand washing, which was associated with duration of stay. Gender differences were also observed. Around 70% of the travellers would have delayed medical consultation for influenza-like illness in China; 12.7% would not wear masks during such episodes of illness. Furthermore, about 30% of the respondents used to wear masks in Hong Kong but not in mainland China. Conclusions: The findings have implications on cross border prevention of SARS. It seems that those travelling during the SARS epidemic were a “self selected” group, and they were using less preventive measures. Special attention and intervention need to be provided to travellers to prevent a second wave cross border transmission of the disease.","public"
"It has tremendous values for both drug discovery and basic research to develop a solid bioinformatical tool for guiding peptide reagent design. Based on the physical and chemical properties of amino acids, a new strategy for peptide reagent design, the so‐called AABPD (amino acid based‐peptide design), is proposed. The peptide samples in a training dataset are described by a series of HMLP (heuristic molecular lipophilicity potential) parameters and other physicochemical properties of amino acid residues that form a three‐dimensional data matrix where each component is defined by three indexes: the first index refers to the peptide samples, the second to the amino acid positions, and the third to the amino acid parameters. The binding free energy between a peptide ligand and its protein receptor is calculated by a linear free energy equation through the physicochemical parameters, resulting in a set of simultaneous linear equations between the bioactivity of the peptides and the physicochemical properties of amino acids. An iterative double least square technique is developed for the solution of the three‐dimensional simultaneous linear equation set to determine the amino acid position coefficients of peptide sequence and the physicochemical parameter coefficients of amino acid residues alternately. The two sets of coefficients thus obtained are used for predicting the bioactivity of other query peptide reagents. Two calculation examples, the peptide substrate specificity of the SARS coronavirus 3C‐like proteinase and the affinity prediction for epitope‐peptides with Class I MHC molecules are studied by using the peptide reagent design strategy. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Although there has been considerable progress in the development of antiviral agents in recent years, there is still a pressing need for new drugs both to improve on the properties of existing agents and to combat the problem of viral resistance. Helicases, both viral and human, have recently emerged as novel targets for the treatment of viral infections. Here, we discuss the role of these enzymes, factors affecting their potential as drug targets and progress in the development of agents that inhibit their activity using the hepatitis C virus-encoded helicase NS3 and the cellular helicase DDX3 adopted for use by HIV-1 as examples.","pharmacology"
"The epidemiology, symptomology, and viral aetiology of endemic influenza remain largely uncharacterized in Cambodia. In December 2006, we established passive hospital-based surveillance to identify the causes of acute undifferentiated fever in patients seeking healthcare. Fever was defined as tympanic membrane temperature >38°C. From December 2006 to December 2008, 4233 patients were screened for influenza virus by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT–PCR). Of these patients, 1151 (27·2%) were positive for influenza. Cough (68·8% vs. 50·5%, P<0·0001) and sore throat (55·0% vs. 41·9%, P<0·0001) were more often associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza-infected patients compared to influenza-negative enrollees. A clear influenza season was evident between July and December with a peak during the rainy season. Influenza A and B viruses were identified in 768 (66·3%) and 388 (33·7%) of the influenza-positive population (n=1153), respectively. In December 2008, passive surveillance identified infection of the avian influenza virus H5N1 in a 19-year-old farmer from Kandal province who subsequently recovered. From a subset of diagnostic samples submitted in 2007, 15 A(H1N1), seven A(H3N2) and seven B viruses were isolated. The predominant subtype tested was influenza A(H1N1), with the majority antigenically related to the A/Solomon Island/03/2006 vaccine strain. The influenza A(H3N2) isolates and influenza B viruses analysed were closely related to A/Brisbane/10/2007 or B/Ohio/01/2005 (B/Victoria/2/87-lineage) vaccine strains, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 region of the HA gene of influenza A(H1N1) viruses demonstrated that the Cambodian isolates belonged to clade 2C along with representative H1N1 viruses circulating in SE Asia at the time. These viruses remained sensitive to oseltamivir. In total, our data suggest that viral influenza infections contribute to nearly one-fifth of acute febrile illnesses and demonstrate the importance of influenza surveillance in Cambodia.","public"
"Viral infections remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. More recent developments in preparative regimens and graft manipulations, as well as the control of well‐recognized post‐transplant infections by the introduction of prophylaxis and preemptive strategies, have influenced the timing and the epidemiology of infections. As new pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus, human coronaviruses HCoV‐NL63 and HCoV‐HKU1, human herpesviruses HHV‐6 and HHV‐7, and polyomaviruses, have emerged, it is fundamental to determine the significance of the newly discovered viruses and their role in the transplantation field.

"Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity, especially in developing countries. Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections. In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections. Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old. A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient. These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT‐PCR or by viral culture. A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n = 5) or 3 (n = 1) viruses. Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n = 25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n = 13), rhinoviruses (n = 8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n = 6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n = 2), and bocavirus (n = 1). These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal. The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies.

"Summary.  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major problem throughout the world. Combination therapy of interferon (IFN) and ribavirin is the best treatment for eradication at present, but the mechanism is not completely understood. We used the HCV replicon system to investigate this mechanism. The effects of six drugs (UDCA, glycyrrhizin, TJ‐9, bezafibrate, ribavirin, and alpha‐IFN 2b) on HCV subgenomic RNA (genotype 1b, NS5B 415Y) were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, cloning and sequencing. The HCV replication was inhibited by alpha‐IFN 2b (7.39–13.2% at 10 U/mL, 3.29–6.12% at 100 U/mL, 1.3–4.86% at 1000 U/mL) and by ribavirin (4.36–13.9% at 100 μg/mL), but not by the other drugs at 24–72 h after treatment. Furthermore, the combination treatment was superior to IFN monotherapy and to ribavirin monotherapy at 72 h post‐treatment. Sequence analyses of the double‐stranded RNA‐activated protein kinase (PKR)‐binding domain and flanking regions within the HCV NS5A region revealed that the total numbers of substitutions caused by ribavirin (n = 36) or combination treatment (n = 57) were more than those of IFN alone (n = 5) and controls (n = 6). The HCV replicon system is the most efficient system for HCV replication and is an excellent choice for testing anti‐HCV drugs and disinfectants. Our results further suggested that the combination of alpha‐IFN 2b and ribavirin might induce mutations, and inhibit HCV RNA synthesis in hepatocytes to a greater extent than ribavirin monotherapy.","virology"

"Objectives: This study aimed at determining the protection factors (PFs) provided by N95 filtering facepiece respirators and surgical masks against particles representing bacterial and viral size ranges (aerodynamic size: 0.04–1.3 μm). Methods: The protection levels of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (four models) and surgical masks (three models) were investigated while they were donned by 12 subjects performing the OSHA (US Occupational Safety and Health Administration) fit-testing exercises in a test chamber. Results: About 29% of N95 respirators and ∼100% of surgical masks had PFs <10, which is the assigned PF designated for this type of respirator by the OSHA. On average, the PFs of N95 respirators were 8–12 times greater than those of surgical masks. The minimum PFs were observed in the size range of 0.04–0.2 μm. No significant difference in PF results was found between N95 respirators with and without an exhalation valve. Conclusions: The study indicates that N95 filtering facepiece respirators may not achieve the expected protection level against bacteria and viruses. An exhalation valve on the N95 respirator does not affect the respiratory protection; it appears to be an appropriate alternative to reduce the breathing resistance.","public"
"A diverse and well-balanced repertoire of T cells is thought to be crucial for the efficacious defence against infection with new or re-emerging pathogens throughout life. In the last third of the mammalian lifespan, the maintenance of a balanced T-cell repertoire becomes highly challenging because of the changes in T-cell production and consumption. In this Review, I question whether latent persistent pathogens might be key factors that drive this imbalance and whether they determine the extent of age-associated immune deficiency.","immunology"
"The 3C-like peptidase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is strictly required for viral replication, thus being a potential target for the development of antiviral agents. In contrast to monomeric picornavirus 3C peptidases, SARS-CoV 3CLpro exists in equilibrium between the monomer and dimer forms in solution, and only the dimer is proteolytically active in dilute buffer solutions. In this study, the increase of SARS-CoV 3CLpro peptidase activity in presence of kosmotropic salts and crowding agents is described. The activation followed the Hofmeister series of anions, with two orders of magnitude enhancement in the presence of Na2SO4, whereas the crowding agents polyethylene glycol and bovine serum albumin increased the hydrolytic rate up to 3 times. Kinetic determinations of the monomer dimer dissociation constant (K d) indicated that activation was a result of a more active dimer, without significant changes in K d values. The activation was found to be independent of substrate length and was derived from both k cat increase and K m decrease. The viral peptidase activation described here could be related to the crowded intracellular environment and indicates a further fine-tuning mechanism for biological control, particularly in the microenvironment of the vesicles that are induced in host cells during positive strand RNA virus infection.","biochemistry"
"While concerns about occupants' health, comfort, energy consumption, and environment are becoming a main design consideration for ventilation systems there are also threats to public safety and security that cannot be overlooked and need to be taken into consideration. A sudden release of chemical and biological agents can pose a safety and security threat to public buildings and can cause injuries and loss of life. Recently air-cleaner technology has been introduced for air sterilization and purification in industrial buildings and hospitals due to its long life, functionality, and sustainability. However this technology has not been applied to the nonindustrial built environment in general, and the possibility of a sudden release of chemical or biological agents in particular has not been addressed. This paper presents a detailed review of previous studies on the measurement of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation effectiveness for decontamination, particularly as related to rooms and mechanical systems (ducting) in buildings. It also discusses the methods used to model the space, as well as the measurements and methods used to measure its performance followed by a comparison of the results and discussion of the possible causes of variance in reported data.","public"

"The −1 ribosomal frameshifting requires the existence of an in cis RNA slippery sequence and is promoted by a downstream stimulator RNA. An atypical RNA pseudoknot with an extra stem formed by complementary sequences within loop 2 of an H-type pseudoknot is characterized in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) genome. This pseudoknot can serve as an efficient stimulator for −1 frameshifting in vitro. Mutational analysis of the extra stem suggests frameshift efficiency can be modulated via manipulation of the secondary structure within the loop 2 of an infectious bronchitis virus-type pseudoknot. More importantly, an upstream RNA sequence separated by a linker 5′ to the slippery site is also identified to be capable of modulating the −1 frameshift efficiency. RNA sequence containing this attenuation element can downregulate −1 frameshifting promoted by an atypical pseudoknot of SARS CoV and two other pseudoknot stimulators. Furthermore, frameshift efficiency can be reduced to half in the presence of the attenuation signal in vivo. Therefore, this in cis RNA attenuator represents a novel negative determinant of general importance for the regulation of −1 frameshift efficiency, and is thus a potential antiviral target.","biochemistry"
"Background: In Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD), histological changes in the colonic mucosa range from minimal inflammation to pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). The disease also recurs in a considerable proportion of patients. Aim: To investigate mucosal immune system cells in colonic biopsies of patients with CDAD. Methods: Colonic biopsies were obtained from 12 control patients with diarrhoea, six patients with CDAD and minimal inflammation, and 10 patients with CDAD with pseudomembranous colitis (samples obtained from areas with and without inflammatory exudate). Immunohistochemical studies were performed using antibodies to T cells (CD3), macrophages (CD68), B/plasma cells (CD79α), and to IgA, IgM, and IgG. Labelled cells in lamina propria were quantified. Results: In contrast to T cells, there were significant reductions in B/plasma cell and macrophage counts in all biopsies from patients with CDAD compared with controls (p<0.001). Studies using anti-immunoglobulin antibodies showed significant reductions in IgA producing cells in CDAD biopsies (p<0.05), with the greatest reduction in samples from patients with PMC. In contrast, there was a significant increase (p<0.05) in IgG producing cells in CDAD biopsies. Only patients with PMC relapsed. In these patients, B/plasma cell and IgA producing cell counts (in biopsies with and without inflammatory exudates) were significantly lower (p<0.01) in mucosal samples from those who subsequently relapsed (five) than those who did not. Conclusions: A selective reduction in mucosal IgA producing cells and macrophages is associated with colonic disease in C difficile infected patients. Severe reduction in colonic IgA producing cells may predispose to recurrence of CDAD.","pathology"
"Ongoing global climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, impacting population dynamics and community structure. There is, however, a critical lack of case studies considering how climatic perturbations affect biotic interactions. Here, we document how an obligate seed dispersal mutualism was disrupted by a temporally anomalous and meteorologically extreme interlude of unseasonably frigid weather, with accompanying snowstorms, in subtropical China, during January–February 2008. Based on the analysis of 5892 fecal samples (representing six mammalian seed dispersers), this event caused a substantial disruption to the relative seed dispersal function for the raisin tree Hovenia dulcis from prestorm 6.29 (2006) and 11.47 (2007), down to 0.35 during the storm (2008). Crucially, this was due to impacts on mammalian seed dispersers and not due to a paucity of fruit, where 4.63 fruit per branch were available in January 2008, vs. 3.73 in 2006 and 3.58 in 2007. An induced dietary shift occurred among omnivorous carnivores during this event, from the consumption fruit to small mammals and birds, reducing their role in seed dispersal substantially. Induced range shift extinguished the functionality of herbivorous mammals completely, however, seed dispersal function was compensated in part by three omnivorous carnivores during poststorm years, and thus while the mutualism remained intact it was enacted by a narrower assemblage of species, rendering the system more vulnerable to extrinsic perturbations. The storm's extended effects also had anthropogenic corollaries – migrating ungulates becoming exposed to heightened levels of illegal hunting – causing long‐term modification to the seed dispersal community and mutualism dynamics. Furthermore, degraded forests proved especially vulnerable to the storm's effects. Considering increasing climate variability and anthropogenic disturbance, the impacts of such massive, aberrant events warrant conservation concern, while affording unique insights into the stability of mutualisms and the processes that structure biodiversity and mediate ecosystem dynamics.","environmental"
"The aim of the work presented here is to study the effectiveness of building air handling units (AHUs) in serving as high volume sampling devices for airborne bacteria and viruses. An HVAC test facility constructed according to ASHRAE Standard 52.2-1999 was used for the controlled loading of HVAC filter media with aerosolized bacteria and virus. Nonpathogenic Bacillus subtilis var. niger was chosen as a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. Three animal viruses; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), avian pneumovirus (APV), and fowlpox virus were chosen as surrogates for three human viruses; SARS coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and smallpox virus; respectively. These bacteria and viruses were nebulized in separate tests and injected into the test duct of the test facility upstream of a MERV 14 filter. SKC Biosamplers upstream and downstream of the test filter served as reference samplers. The collection efficiency of the filter media was calculated to be 96.5 ± 1.5% for B. subtilis, however no collection efficiency was measured for the viruses as no live virus was ever recovered from the downstream samplers. Filter samples were cut from the test filter and eluted by hand-shaking. An extraction efficiency of 105 ± 19% was calculated for B. subtilis. The viruses were extracted at much lower efficiencies (0.7–20%). Our results indicate that the airborne concentration of spore-forming bacteria in building AHUs may be determined by analyzing the material collected on HVAC filter media, however culture-based analytical techniques are impractical for virus recovery. Molecular-based identification techniques such as PCR could be used.","environmental"
"RNA interference (RNAi) quietly crept into biological research in the 1990s when unexpected gene-silencing phenomena in plants and flatworms first perplexed scientists. Following the demonstration of RNAi in mammalian cells in 2001, it was quickly realized that this highly specific mechanism of sequence-specific gene silencing might be harnessed to develop a new class of drugs that interfere with disease-causing or disease-promoting genes. Here we discuss the considerations that go into developing RNAi-based therapeutics starting from in vitro lead design and identification, to in vivo pre-clinical drug delivery and testing. We conclude by reviewing the latest clinical experience with RNAi therapeutics.","pharmacology"
"HIV-1 uses a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift to synthesize the precursor of its enzymes, Gag-Pol. The frameshift efficiency that is critical for the virus replication, is controlled by an interaction between the ribosome and a specific structure on the viral mRNA, the frameshift stimulatory signal. The rate of cap-dependent translation initiation is known to be altered by the TAR RNA structure, present at the 5′ and 3′ end of all HIV-1 mRNAs. Depending upon its concentration, TAR activates or inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). We investigated here whether changes in translation initiation caused by TAR affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. CD4+ T cells and 293T cells were transfected with a dual-luciferase construct where the firefly luciferase expression depends upon the HIV-1 frameshift. Translation initiation was altered by adding TAR in cis or trans of the reporter mRNA. We show that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency correlates negatively with changes in the rate of translation initiation caused by TAR and mediated by PKR. A model is presented where changes in the rate of initiation affect the probability of frameshifting by altering the distance between elongating ribosomes on the mRNA, which influences the frequency of encounter between these ribosomes and the frameshift stimulatory signal.","biochemistry"
"Background: The epidemiology of respiratory viruses and their potential clinical impact when recovered in lower respiratory specimens has not been established in the hospital setting. A study was performed to investigate the association between positive viral detection and respiratory infection in an at-risk population. Methods: 299 adult patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures were enrolled in a hospital-based prospective cohort study. Descriptive epidemiology is presented of 17 different respiratory viruses detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays in BAL fluid specimens. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify the clinical characteristics independently associated with the presence of virus. Results: Of 522 BAL fluid specimens analysed, 81% were collected in adult transplant recipients or other immunocompromised patients. Overall, PCR assays identified viral nucleic acid in 91 BAL fluid samples (17.4%). Similar rates of virus-positive BAL fluid were found in the different subpopulations studied (p = 0.113). Coronaviruses were the most frequent (32.3%), followed by rhinovirus (22.6%), parainfluenza (19.5%), influenza (9.7%), respiratory synctial virus (8.6%), human metapneumovirus (4.2%) and bocavirus (3.1%). Multivariate analysis using mixed models showed that respiratory viral infections were associated with a lack of antibiotic treatment response (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1) and the absence of radiological infiltrate (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). In lung transplant recipients in whom a respiratory infection was suspected, the respiratory viral detection rate was 24.4% compared with 13.8% overall in other patients (p = 0.02). Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalised adults, respiratory viruses detected in BAL fluid specimens were associated with respiratory symptoms, absence of radiological infiltrates and a poor response to antibiotic therapy.","respiratory"

"The apparent family clustering of avian influenza A/H5N1 has led several groups to postulate the existence of a host genetic influence on susceptibility to A/H5N1, yet the role of host factors on the risk of A/H5N1 disease has received remarkably little attention compared to the efforts focused on viral factors. We examined the epidemiological patterns of human A/H5N1 cases, their possible explanations, and the plausibility of a host genetic effect on susceptibility to A/H5N1 infection. The preponderance of familial clustering of cases and the relative lack of non-familial clusters, the occurrence of related cases separated by time and place, and the paucity of cases in some highly exposed groups such as poultry cullers, are consistent with a host genetic effect. Animal models support the biological plausibility of genetic susceptibility to A/H5N1. Although the evidence is circumstantial, host genetic factors are a parsimonious explanation for the unusual epidemiology of human A/H5N1 cases and warrant further investigation.","public"
"Background. The primary modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appear to be direct mucus membrane contact with infectious droplets and through exposure to formites. Knowledge of the survival characteristics of the virus is essential for formulating appropriate infection-control measures. Methods. Survival of SARS-CoV strain GVU6109 was studied in stool and respiratory specimens. Survival of the virus on different environmental surfaces, including a laboratory request form, an impervious disposable gown, and a cotton nondisposable gown, was investigated. The virucidal effects of sodium hypochlorite, house detergent, and a peroxygen compound (Virkon S; Antec International) on the virus were also studied. Results. SARS-CoV GVU6109 can survive for 4 days in diarrheal stool samples with an alkaline pH, and it can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for >7 days at room temperature. Even at a relatively high concentration (104 tissue culture infective doses/mL), the virus could not be recovered after drying of a paper request form, and its infectivity was shown to last longer on the disposable gown than on the cotton gown. All disinfectants tested were shown to be able to reduce the virus load by >3 log within 5 min. Conclusions. Fecal and respiratory samples can remain infectious for a long period of time at room temperature. The risk of infection via contact with droplet-contaminated paper is small. Absorbent material, such as cotton, is preferred to nonabsorptive material for personal protective clothing for routine patient care where risk of large spillage is unlikely. The virus is easily inactivated by commonly used disinfectants.","microbiology"
"The 34 kDa main proteinase (Mpro) from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) plays an important role in the virus life cycle through the specific processing of viral polyproteins. As such, SARS‐CoV Mpro is a key target for the identification of specific inhibitors directed against the SARS virus. With a view to facilitating the development of such compounds, crystals were obtained of the enzyme at pH 6.5 in the orthorhombic space group P21212 that diffract to a resolution of 1.9 Å. These crystals contain one monomer per asymmetric unit and the biologically active dimer is generated via the crystallographic twofold axis. The conformation of the catalytic site indicates that the enzyme is active in the crystalline form and thus suitable for structure‐based inhibition studies.","crystallography"
"The ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses has been exploited to develop potent anti‐cancer immunotherapies. Recent clinical trials exploring the efficacy of ex vivo modified autologous DC‐based vaccines have reported some promising results. However, in vitro generation of autologous DCs for clinical administration, their loading with tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and their activation, is laborious and expensive, and, as a result of inter‐individual variability in the personalized vaccines, remains poorly standardized. An attractive alternative approach is to load resident DCs in vivo by targeted delivery of TAAs, using viral vectors and activating them simultaneously. To this end, we have constructed genetically‐modified adenoviral (Ad) vectors and bispecific adaptor molecules to retarget Ad vectors encoding TAAs to the CD40 receptor on DCs. Pre‐clinical human and murine studies conducted so far have clearly demonstrated the suitability of a ‘two‐component’ (i.e. Ad and adaptor molecule) configuration for targeted modification of DCs in vivo for cancer immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of CD40‐targeted Ad‐based cancer vaccines and highlights pre‐clinical issues in the clinical translation of this approach.

"A growing number of studies support a tendency toward preferential host switching, by parasites and pathogens, over relatively short phylogenetic distances. This suggests that a host switch is more probable if a potential host is closely related to the original host than if it is a more distant relative. However, despite its importance for the health of humans, livestock, and wildlife, the detailed dynamics of preferential host switching have, so far, been little studied. We present an empirical test of two theoretical models of preferential host switching, using observed phylogenetic distributions of host species for RNA viruses of three mammal orders (primates, carnivores, and ungulates). The analysis focuses on multihost RNA virus species, because their presence on multiple hosts and their estimated ages of origin indicate recent host switching. Approximate Bayesian computation was used to compare observed phylogenetic distances between hosts with those simulated under the theoretical models. The results support a decreasing sigmoidal model of preferential host switching, with a strong effect from increasing phylogenetic distance, on all three studied host phylogenies. This suggests that the dynamics of host switching are fundamentally similar for RNA viruses of different mammal orders and, potentially, a wider range of coevolutionary systems.","genetics"

The supercomplex is a unique hollow, cylinder-like structure assembled from eight copies of nsp8 and held tightly together by eight copies of nsp7. With an internal diameter of ∼30 Å, the central channel has dimensions and positive electrostatic properties favorable for nucleic acid binding, implying that its role is to confer processivity on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.","cell"
"Accurate clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) based on the current World Health Organization definition is difficult and at times impossible at the early stage of the disease. Both false positive and false negative cases are commonly encountered and this could have far‐reaching detrimental effects on the patients, their family and the clinicians alike. Contact history is particularly important in diagnosing SARS in children as their presenting features are often non‐specific. The difficulty in making a correct diagnosis is further compounded by the lack of a sensitive rapid diagnostic test. Serology is not particularly helpful in the initial triaging of patients as it takes at least 3 weeks to become positive. Co‐infection and other treatable conditions should not be missed and conventional antibiotics should remain as part of the first‐line treatment regimen. We report five cases to illustrate the difficulties and dilemmas faced by clinicians in diagnosing SARS in children.","pediatrics"

"Ultrathin poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) stereocomplex films with macromolecularly double-stranded regular nanostructures were prepared by layer-by-layer assembly of isotactic and syndiotactic PMMAs on solid surfaces. Antibodies were immobilized through the Fc region-capturing protein A, which had been physically adsorbed on the complex film, and the binding of antigens to immobilized antibodies was quantitatively investigated by the quartz crystal microbalance technique. Greater amounts of protein A with native forms were adsorbed on the complex film than those on conventional single-component PMMA films. Antibodies with high target-binding activities were also immobilized on the complex film. A greater amount of antigens could be detected on the complex film. The activity of protein A was maintained on the complex for a long time even within a dried state. The mechanism for the preservation of protein native forms on the complex surface was speculated by analyzing the physical adsorption of proteins with various secondary structures. Stereocomplex films can be utilized as novel coating nanomaterials for efficiently detecting protein−protein interactions.","chemistry"

"One of the most intriguing questions in stem cell biology is whether pluripotent stem cells exist in adult tissues. Several groups of investigators employing i) various isolation protocols, ii) detection of surface markers, and iii) experimental in vitro and in vivo models, have reported the presence of cells that possess a pluripotent character in adult tissues. Such cells were assigned various operational abbreviations and names in the literature that added confusion to the field and raised the basic question of whether these are truly distinct or overlapping populations of the same primitive stem cells. Unfortunately, these cells were never characterized side-by-side to address this important issue. Nevertheless, taking into consideration their common features described in the literature, it is very likely that various investigators have described overlapping populations of developmentally early stem cells that are closely related. These different populations of stem cells will be reviewed in this paper.","medicine"
"The aerosol form of the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague, a rapidly fatal disease. At present, no plague vaccines are available for use in the United States. One candidate for the development of a subunit vaccine is the Y. pestis virulence (V) antigen, a protein that mediates the function of the Yersinia outer protein virulence factors and suppresses inflammatory responses in the host. On the basis of the knowledge that adenovirus (Ad) gene-transfer vectors act as adjuvants in eliciting host immunity against the transgene they carry, we tested the hypothesis that a single administration of a replication-defective Ad gene-transfer vector encoding the Y. pestis V antigen (AdsecV) could stimulate strong protective immune responses without a requirement for repeat administration. AdsecV elicited specific T cell responses and high IgG titers in serum within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization. Importantly, the mice were protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis CO92 from 4 weeks up to 6 months after immunization with a single intramuscular dose of AdsecV. These observations suggest that an Ad gene-transfer vector expressing V antigen is a candidate for development of an effective anti-plague vaccine","microbiology"
"Summary.  We have analysed and identified different membrane‐active regions of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein by observing the effect of 18‐mer core‐derived peptide libraries from two HCV strains on the integrity of different membrane model systems. In addition, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane‐interacting peptides from the HCV core protein, both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems. Our results show that the HCV core protein region comprising the C‐terminus of domain 1 and the N‐terminus of domain 2 seems to be the most active in membrane interaction, although a role in protein–protein interaction cannot be excluded. Significantly, the secondary structure of nearly all the assayed peptides changes in the presence of model membranes. These sequences most probably play a relevant part in the biological action of HCV in lipid interaction. Furthermore, these membranotropic regions could be envisaged as new possible targets, as inhibition of its interaction with the membrane could potentially lead to new vaccine strategies.","virology"
"Using a highly reproducible and robust cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, the authors screened a 100,000-compound library at 14- and 114-µM compound concentration against influenza strain A/Udorn/72 (H3N2). The “hit” rates (>50% inhibition of the viral cytopathic effect) from the 14- and 114-µM screens were 0.022% and 0.38%, respectively. The hits were evaluated for their antiviral activity, cell toxicity, and selectivity in dose-response experiments. The screen at the lower concentration yielded 3 compounds, which displayed moderate activity (SI50 = 10-49). Intriguingly, the screen at the higher concentration revealed several additional hits. Two of these hits were highly active with an SI50 > 50. Time of addition experiments revealed 1 compound that inhibited early and 4 other compounds that inhibited late in the virus life cycle, suggesting they affect entry and replication, respectively. The active compounds represent several different classes of molecules such as carboxanilides, 1-benzoyl-3-arylthioureas, sulfonamides, and benzothiazinones, which have not been previously identified as having antiviral/anti-influenza activity.

"Tat transactivating activity regulated by NAD+‐dependent histone deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) connects HIV transcription with the metabolic state of the cell. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is a rate‐limiting enzyme in the mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis. Nampt, SIRT1, and AMPK were involved in inhibiting HIV‐1 transactivation through redox‐regulated pathway. Tanshinone II A is a main lipid‐soluble monomer derivative from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) and tanshinone II A possess a variety of biological activities through redox signaling pathway. Here we investigated the effect of tanshinone II A on Tat‐induced HIV‐1 transactivation and the redox signaling pathway involved in it. As the results were shown, tanshinone II A reversed Tat‐induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and down‐regulation of glutathione (GSH) levels in TZM‐bl cells through up‐regulation of Nrf2 expression. Tanshinone II A reversed Tat‐induced inhibition of SIRT1 activity but not SIRT1 protein expression. Tanshinone II A reversed Tat‐induced inhibition of Nampt protein expression and depletion of NAD+ levels in TZM‐bl cells in a dose‐dependent manner. Tanshinone II A‐evoked Nampt expression was mediated by AMPK signaling pathway. Tanshinone II A inhibited Tat‐induced HIV‐1 LTR transactivation dependent on AMPK‐Nampt pathway. Collectively, our data provide new insights into understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tanshinone II A inhibited Tat‐regulated transcription, suggesting that targeting AMPK/Nampt/SIRT1 pathway could serve as new anti‐HIV‐1 agents.

"Motivation: The past decade has seen extension in the methods of sequence analysis from single gene based to analyzing multiple genes and proteins simultaneously. Consequently, there is a need for software tools that will allow mining of these enormous datasets at genome level effectively. A key challenge is to make them user-friendly, available to a larger community and integrate with public domain software without much hassle. Results: A web-based interactive computational tool is described for visualization and comparison of gene order from prokaryotic and selected viral genome data. Many intriguing similarities and differences in gene order of multiple genomes can be compared and revealed. The interface facilitates easy extraction of the nucleotide sequence of the gene of interest and BLAST analysis against GenBank at NCBI to provide insights into gene functions and orthologs of the gene in other species.

"Crystallization trials at the Division of Structural Biology in Oxford are now almost exclusively carried out using a high‐throughput workflow implemented in the Oxford Protein Production Facility. Initial crystallization screening is based on nanolitre‐scale sitting‐drop vapour‐diffusion experiments (typically 100 nl of protein plus 100 nl of reservoir solution per droplet) which use standard crystallization screening kits and 96‐well crystallization plates. For 294 K crystallization trials the barcoded crystallization plates are entered into an automated storage system with a fully integrated imaging system. These plates are imaged in accordance with a pre‐programmed schedule and the resulting digital data for each droplet are harvested into a laboratory information‐management system (LIMS), scored by crystal recognition software and displayed for user analysis via a web‐based interface. Currently, storage for trials at 277 K is not automated and for imaging the crystallization plates are fed by hand into an imaging system from which the data enter the LIMS. The workflow includes two procedures for nanolitre‐scale optimization of crystallization conditions: (i) a protocol for variation of pH, reservoir dilution and protein:reservoir ratio and (ii) an additive screen. Experience based on 592 crystallization projects is reported.","crystallography"
"The structure of the human MHC‐I molecule HLA‐A*1101 in complex with a nonameric peptide (KTFPPTEPK) has been determined by X‐ray crystallography to 1.45 Å resolution. The peptide is derived from the SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid protein positions 362–370 (SNP362–370). It is conserved in all known isolates of SARS‐CoV and has been verified by in vitro peptide‐binding studies to be a good to intermediate binder to HLA‐A*0301 and HLA‐A*1101, with IC50 values of 70 and 186 nM, respectively [Sylvester‐Hvid et al. (2004), Tissue Antigens, 63, 395–400]. In terms of the residues lining the peptide‐binding groove, the HLA‐A*1101–SNP362–370 complex is very similar to other known structures of HLA‐­A*1101 and HLA‐A*6801. The SNP362–370 peptide is held in place by 17 hydrogen bonds to the α‐chain residues and by nine water molecules which are also tightly bound in the peptide‐binding groove. Thr6 of the peptide (Thr6p) does not make efficient use of the middle (E) pocket. For vaccine development, there seems to be a potential for optimization targeted at this position. All residues except Thr2p and Lys9p are accessible for T‐cell recognition.","crystallography"

"Background. The procoagulant tissue factor (TF) is thought to play a role in the coagulation disorders that characterize filoviral infections. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenesis of lethal infection with the Angola strain of Marburg virus (MARV-Ang) in rhesus macaques and tested the efficacy of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), an inhibitor of TF/factor VIIa, as a potential treatment. Methods. Twelve rhesus macaques were challenged with a high dose (1000 pfu) of MARV-Ang. Six macaques were treated with rNAPc2, and 6 macaques served as control animals. Results. All 6 control animals succumbed to MARV-Ang challenge by day 8 (mean, 7.3 days), whereas 5 of 6 rNAPc2-treated animals died on day 9 and 1 rNAPc2-treated animal survived. The disease course for MARVAng infection appeared to progress more rapidly in rhesus macaques than has been previously reported for other strains of MARV. In contrast to Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in macaques, up-regulation of TF was not as striking, and deposition of fibrin was a less prominent pathologic feature of disease in these animals. Conclusions. These data show that the pathogenicity of MARV-Ang infection appears to be consistent with the apparent increased human virulence attributed to this strain. The apparent reduced efficacy of rNAPc2 against MARV-Ang infection, compared with its efficacy against EBOV infection, appears to be associated with differences in TF induction and fibrin deposition.","microbiology"

"BACKGROUND: A 2011 nationwide school pandemic preparedness study found schools to be deficient. We examined the impact of a school nurse educational intervention aimed at improving K‐12 school biological event preparedness. METHODS: Missouri Association of School Nurses (MASN) members were e‐mailed a survey link in fall 2013 (ie, preintervention), links to online education modules (ie, intervention) in late fall, and a postintervention survey link in spring, 2014. School biological event readiness was measured using 35 indicators, for a possible score range of 0‐35. A paired t‐test compared pre‐ to postintervention preparedness scores. RESULTS: A total of 133 school nurses (33.6% response rate) completed a survey; 35.3% of those (N = 47) completed both pre‐ and postintervention survey that could be matched. Pre‐ and postintervention preparedness scores ranged from 5 to 28.5 (x‾ = 13.3) and 6.5 to 25 (x‾ = 14.8), respectively. Postintervention scores were significantly higher than preintervention scores for those who watched at least 1 module (t = −2.3, p < .05). CONCLUSION:: The education intervention was effective at improving school preparedness, though the impact was small. The education intervention needs to be reassessed, especially in regard to providing a longer intervention period.","public"

"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first occurred in southern China at the end of 2002 and has caused more than 8000 illnesses in total with over 700 fatalities as of end of August 2003. A unique collaborative effort, led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and uniting several laboratories from around the world, allowed the identification of the causative agent within only one month. It is a hitherto unknown novel coronavirus (provisionally termed SARS-associated coronavirus or SARS-CoV) that fulfills Kochs postulates. The virus is easily propagated in cell culture (under suitable highsecurity laboratory conditions) which should facilitate further studies into its stability as well as the development of antivirally active substances and vaccines. Although diagnostic laboratory tests, particularly for the detection of viral nucleic acid and virusspecific antibodies, were quickly available, the case definition for SARS continues to be based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. In view of the threat of a (seasonal) recurrence of the infection it is urgently necessary to evaluate and to further improve the available laboratory methods. SARS is a good example of how rapidly an infectious disease may spread through international travel activities; but it also demonstrates the importance of a wellcoordinated international cooperation in such a case. Through the use of the latest advances together with more traditional laboratory methods and the constant exchange of (interim) results, patient samples and reagents, an unprecedented collaborative effort soon achieved a breakthrough. This should provide encouragement in the struggle against other novel infectious agents.","medical"
"Relevant blood transfusion-transmitted viruses are still HBV, HCV and HIV. As newly emerged infectious agent, the vCJD prion is relevant as well and will cause difficulties within the next decade, since there is no diagnostic tool applicable to blood donation testing. Still, the most effective measure for the virus safety of blood is donor selection followed by antibody and nucleic acid testing, followed by derichment and inactivation performed to the extent possible. For selected recipients, relevant viruses are CMV and Parvovirus B19. Diagnostic testing for both viruses is no challenge. The prevalence of HTLV-I is very low in Germany but higher in many other countries. Therefore epidemiological surveillance is sufficient to control the spreading of this retrovirus in Germany. As the West Nile fever virus and the SARS coronavirus demonstrate, old viruses may newly enter the donor population and the efficient way to prevent these viruses from spreading is still the usual quarantine for donors who have visited contaminated areas. The history of blood transfusion shows that by taking appropriate measures safety will be increased, but also that new infectious agents will enter the donor population in future years.","medical"

"Background. Previous studies have shown that common human coronavirus might be neurotropic, although it was first isolated as a pathogen of the respiratory tract. We noticed that a few patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experienced central nervous symptoms during the course of illness. In the present study, we isolated a SARS coronavirus strain from a brain tissue specimen obtained from a patient with SARS with significant central nervous symptoms. Methods. Using transmission electronic microscopy and nested reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, the causative pathogen was identified in cultures of a brain tissue specimen obtained from the patient with SARS. Histopathologic examination of the brain tissue was performed using the methods of immunohistochemistry analysis and double immunofluorescence staining. Fifteen cytokines and chemokines were detected in the blood of the patient with SARS by means of a bead-based multiassay system. Results. A fragment specific for SARS human coronavirus was amplified from cultures of the brain suspension, and transmission electronic microscopy revealed the presence of an enveloped virus morphologically compatible with a coronavirus isolated in the cultures. Pathologic examination of the brain tissue revealed necrosis of neuron cells and broad hyperplasia of gliocytes. Immunostaining demonstrated that monokine induced by interferon-Γ (Mig) was expressed in gliocytes with the infiltration of CD68+ monocytes/macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes in the brain mesenchyme. Cytokine/chemokine assay revealed that levels of interferon-Γ–inducible protein 10 and Mig in the blood were highly elevated, although the levels of other cytokines and chemokines were close to normal. Conclusions. This study provides direct evidence that SARS human coronavirus is capable of infecting the central nervous system, and that Mig might be involved in the brain immunopathology of SARS.","microbiology"
"Granzymes (gzms) are a group of serine proteases that play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, blood coagulation, apoptosis, and inflammation, but are also connected to atherosclerosis, diabetes, cardiovascular and inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, and sepsis. Humans have five gzms (gzms A, B, H, K, and M), which differ in their substrate specificity. It is widely accepted that they are delivered from cytotoxic lymphocytes via perforin into the cytoplasm of target cells where they initiate cell death, modulate cytokine signaling, or inactivate pathogen proteins. However, more recent evidence indicates gzms also act extracellularly in noncytotoxic processes. Proteomic approaches are directed at mapping gzm cleavage specificity, identifying substrates, and unraveling the (patho‐) physiological role of these proteases. These studies have refined our understanding of gzm species specificity, and collectively uncovered an enormous number of new substrates. However, with the exception of a very few human gzmB substrates supported by independent data (Bid, DNA‐PK, PARP, ICAD, and procaspase 7), it is presently unclear which are physiologically relevant. This review aims to summarize and analyze the different proteomic approaches used and discuss both their convincing and controversial outcomes.","biochemical"
"The energetic determinants that drive specific protein−protein interactions are not entirely understood. We describe simultaneous in vivo selection of specific and stable interactions using homologous peptides which compete with protein libraries for an interaction with a target molecule. Library members binding to their target, and promoting cell growth, must outcompete competitor interactions with the target (i.e., competition) and evade binding to the competitors (i.e., negative design). We term this a competitive and negative design initiative (CANDI). We combined CANDI with a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) and observed major specificity improvements, by driving selection of winning library members that bind their target with maximum efficacy, ensuring that otherwise energetically accessible alternatives are inaccessible. CANDI−PCA has been used with libraries targeted at coiled coil regions of oncogenic AP-1 components cJun and cFos. We demonstrate that comparable hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions in desired species are compromised in nondesired species when CANDI is executed, demonstrating that both core and electrostatic residues are required to direct specific interactions. Major energetic differences (≥5.6 kcal/mol) are observed between desired and nondesired interaction stabilities for a CANDI−PCA derived peptide relative to a conventional PCA derived helix, with significantly more stability (3.2 kcal/mol) than the wild-type cJun−cFos complex. As a negative control, a library lacking a residue repertoire able to generate a specific and stable helix was tested. Negative protein design has broad implications in generating specific and therapeutically relevant peptide-based drugs, proteins able to act with minimal cross-talk to homologues or analogues, and in nanobiotechnological design.","biochemistry"
"The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is reported to function in encapsidating the viral genomic RNA into helical nucleocapsid, and its self-association is believed to be vital in coating the viral genomic RNA. Characterization of SARS-CoV N multimerization may thereby help us better understand the coronavirus assembly. In the current work, using the yeast two-hybrid technique, an unexpected interaction between residues 1−210 and 211−290 (central region) of the SARS-CoV N protein was detected, and SPR results further revealed that the SR-rich motif (amino acids 183−197) of SARS-CoV N protein is responsible for such an interaction. Chemical cross-linking and gel-filtration analyses indicated that the residues 283−422 of the SARS-CoV N protein have multimeric ability, although the full-length N protein is prone to exist predominantly as dimers. In addition, the multimeric ability of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could be weakened by the SR-rich motif interaction with the central region (amino acids 211−290). All of these data suggested that the SR-rich motif of the SARS-CoV N protein might play an import role in the transformation of the SARS-CoV N protein between the dimer and multimer during its binding to its central region for self-association or dissociation. This current paper will hopefully provide some new ideas in studying SARS-CoV N multimerization.","biochemistry"

"Point-of-Care-Testing (POCT) in der klinisch-mikrobiologischen Akutdiagnostik von gemeingefährlichen Infektionskrankheiten könnte nach einem Großschadensereignis, beispielsweise nach einem bioterroristischen Anschlag, die vor Ort verantwortlichen Führungskräfte bei ihrer ethisch schwierigen Aufgabe, der Triage der betroffenen Personen, unterstützen. Aufgrund des in einer solchen Krisensituation möglicherweise erheblichen Einflusses auf die Gesundheit der Allgemeinbevölkerung ist POCT in diesem Bereich weltweit von Bedeutung und entsprechende Weiterentwicklungen sind von großem Interesse. Wegen der Folgen, die sich für die betroffenen Personen aus den Testresultaten ergeben könnten, sind bei der Evaluierung und Validierung strengste Maßstäbe anzulegen. Allgemein gilt, dass die Qualität von POCT in direktem Zusammenhang mit der Qualität der medizinischen Versorgung von Patienten steht. Deshalb muss patientennahe Labordiagnostik grundsätzlich auch dieselben Qualitätsstandards erfüllen wie Untersuchungen in einem medizinischen Zentrallabor. Die Weiterentwicklung von POCT zum Nachweis von Agenzien, die im Rahmen eines bioterroristischen Anschlags verwendet werden könnten, ist sehr aufwändig, kostenintensiv und nicht ohne Gefahren. Auch die Präanalytik ist bei diesen Tests meist sehr anspruchsvoll und von unerfahrenen Personen kaum zu leisten. Aufgrund unzureichender Leistungsdaten der Tests kommt es bei niedriger Prävalenz der nachzuweisenden Infektion zu einer hohen immanenten Falsch-negativ-Rate und damit unter Umständen zu einer falschen Einschätzung der Katastrophenlage. Unter Beachtung dieser Aspekte muss der Sinn entsprechender Weiterentwicklungen diskutiert werden. Hinzu kommt, dass die Kenntnisse bezüglich B-Agenzien und der Erkennung der gegebenenfalls durch ihren Einsatz hervorgerufenen Krankheitsbilder unter den in Deutschland klinisch tätigen Ärzten eher gering sind. Daher ist es fraglich, ob die Möglichkeiten von spezifischem POCT zur Aufklärung von B-Agenzien überhaupt sinnvoll genutzt würden. Ein weiteres Feld ist die Diagnostik im Rahmen eines natürlichen außergewöhnlichen Seuchengeschehens (ASG). Hier liegen ausgiebige Erfahrungen mit POCT bei Influenza-Epidemien und -Pandemien vor. Es zeigt sich auch hier das Problem, dass zu Beginn eines Ausbruchs, d.h. bei noch relativ niedriger Prävalenz der Erkrankung, teilweise extrem hohe Raten falsch-negativer Ergebnisse auftreten, die eine falsche Sicherheit vermitteln und zu einer unter Umständen fatalen Fehleinschätzung der Lage führen können. Der “Orphan”-Status potentieller B-Agenzien und in Deutschland nicht endemischer Infektionskrankheiten hat ein Defizit an ausreichend sensitiven und zuverlässigen, kommerziellen Schnellnachweis-Tests zur Folge. Es werden jedoch derzeit molekularbiologische Hand-Held-Schnelltests (Stichwort: Lab-on-a-Chip) entwickelt, die in Zukunft gegebenenfalls auch als POCT Verwendung finden könnten.","medical"

"The 5′ cap structures of higher eukaryote mRNAs have ribose 2′-O-methylation. Likewise, many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have evolved 2′-O-methyltransferases to autonomously modify their mRNAs. However, a defined biological role for 2′-O-methylation of mRNA remains elusive. Here we show that 2′-O-methylation of viral mRNA was critically involved in subverting the induction of type I interferon. We demonstrate that human and mouse coronavirus mutants lacking 2′-O-methyltransferase activity induced higher expression of type I interferon and were highly sensitive to type I interferon. Notably, the induction of type I interferon by viruses deficient in 2′-O-methyltransferase was dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA sensor Mda5. This link between Mda5-mediated sensing of viral RNA and 2′-O-methylation of mRNA suggests that RNA modifications such as 2′-O-methylation provide a molecular signature for the discrimination of self and non-self mRNA.","immunology"
"C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) are activated in course of many viral infections. Here we analyzed the activity of JNK inhibitors on influenza A virus (IAV) amplification. Human lung epithelial cells were infected with either the highly pathogenic avian virus strain A/FPV/Bratislava/79 (H7N7) or the pandemic swine-origin influenza virus A/Hamburg/4/09 (H1N1v). The application of the JNK inhibitors SP600125 and AS601245 reduced IAV amplification by suppressing viral protein and RNA synthesis. Although AS601245 appeared to generally block the transcription of newly introduced genes, SP600125 specifically affected viral RNA synthesis. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of SEK/MKK4 and siRNA-mediated suppression of JNK2 expression confirmed that specific manipulation of the JNK pathway attenuates virus propagation. An IAV minigenome replication assay revealed that SP600125 did not directly affect the activity of the viral RNA polymerase complex but seems to suppress an anti-influenza nonstructural protein 1-mediated virus supportive function. Finally, when H7N7- or H1N1v-infected mice were treated with SP600125, the viral load is reduced in lungs of treated compared with untreated mice. Our data suggest that this class of ATP competitive inhibitors once optimized for antiviral action potentially represent novel drugs for antiviral intervention.","biochemistry"
"The Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction cascade belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Raf/MEK/ERK signaling leads to stimulus-specific changes in gene expression, alterations in cell metabolism or induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and thus controls cell differentiation and proliferation. It is induced by extracellular agents, including pathogens such as RNA viruses. Many DNA viruses are known to induce cellular signaling via this pathway. As these pathogens partly use the DNA synthesis machinery for their replication, they aim to drive cells into a proliferative state. In contrast, the consequences of RNA virus-induced Raf/MEK/ERK signaling were less clear for a long time, but since the turn of the century the number of publications on this topic has rapidly increased. Research on this virus/host-interaction will broaden our understanding of its relevance in viral replication. This important control center of cellular responses is differently employed to support the replication of several important human pathogenic RNA viruses including influenza, Ebola, hepatitis C and SARS corona viruses.","biochemistry"

"In order to investigate the clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the autopsies of three patients who died from SARS in Nan Fang Hospital Guangdong, China were studied retrospectively. Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to study all of the tissues from the three cases. The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing. The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells. There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes. Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles. Thrombosis was present in small veins. Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland. Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue. SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs. The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged, in November 2002, as a novel agent causing severe respiratory illness. To study sequence variation in the SARS-CoV genome, we determined the nucleic acid sequence of the S and N genes directly from clinical specimens from 10 patients—1 specimen with no matched SARS-CoV isolate, from 2 patients; multiple specimens from 3 patients; and matched clinical-specimen/ cell-culture-isolate pairs from 6 patients. We identified 3 nucleotide substitutions that were most likely due to natural variation and 2 substitutions that arose after cell-culture passage of the virus. These data demonstrate the overall stability of the S and N genes of SARS-CoV over 3 months during which a minimum of 4 generations for transmission events occurred. These findings are a part of the expanding investigation of the evolution of how this virus adapts to a new host.","microbiology"

Results: Compared to the O cases P patients had a longer mean duration of fever (3.66 (SD 2.3) v 8.57 (SD 2.44) days), lower mean thrombocytopenia (248.3 (SD 82.7) v 173.7 (SD 49.0)×109/l), leucopenia (8.19 (SD 4.45) v 3.06 (SD 1.02)×109/l), lymphopenia (2.79 (SD 1.97) v 1.44 (SD 0.75)×109/l), and neutropenia (4.48 (SD 2.88) v 1.24 (SD 0.43)×109/l). Chest auscultation was abnormal in 71% of P patients, with mild crepitations detected. All had abnormal chest radiographs versus 39% of S cases, and 27% of O cases. Conclusions: There are no distinguishing clinical features of paediatric SARS. The diagnosis is suggested by the paucity of clinical signs with an abnormal chest radiograph, and laboratory evidence of leucopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia.","pediatrics"
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive, and sometime fatal disease with more than 1800 patients in over a dozen countries in Asia, Europe, and North America (including the United States and Canada) within two months. On 12 March 2003, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a global alert about SARS so it became a global challenge. Strengthening the public health measures at schools would protect children as well as providing the students an opportunity to learn about infectious disease control through life event approach. The public health measures at schools include two important components: basic understanding of the disease so schools would put on high alert on caution cases, and the measures to improve environmental hygiene at schools and preventive measures to stop infectious disease transmission. This will help to empower the whole community the readiness to deal with other outbreaks in the future.","public"
"Background. The lectin DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin) augments Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. However, it its unclear whether DC-SIGN promotes only EBOV attachment (attachment factor function, nonessential) or actively facilitates EBOV entry (receptor function, essential). Methods. We investigated whether DC-SIGN on B cell lines and dendritic cells acts as an EBOV attachment factor or receptor. Results. Engineered DC-SIGN expression rendered some B cell lines susceptible to EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP)-driven infection, whereas others remained refractory, suggesting that cellular factors other than DC-SIGN are also required for susceptibility to EBOV infection. Augmentation of entry was independent of efficient DCSIGN internalization and might not involve lectin-mediated endocytic uptake of virions. Therefore, DC-SIGN is unlikely to function as an EBOV receptor on B cell lines; instead, it might concentrate virions onto cells, thereby allowing entry into cell lines expressing low levels of endogenous receptor(s). Indeed, artificial concentration of virions onto cells mirrored DC-SIGN expression, confirming that optimization of viral attachment is sufficient for EBOV GP-driven entry into some B cell lines. Finally, EBOV infection of dendritic cells was only partially dependent on mannose-specific lectins, such as DC-SIGN, suggesting an important contribution of other factors. Conclusions. Our results indicate that DC-SIGN is not an EBOV receptor but, rather, is an attachmentpromoting factor that boosts entry into B cell lines susceptible to low levels of EBOV GP-mediated infection.","microbiology"
"To extend the potential of antibodies and their derivatives to provide passive protection against enteric infections when supplied orally in crude plant extracts, we have expressed both a small immune protein (SIP) and a full‐length antibody in plants using two different plant virus vectors based on potato virus X (PVX) and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The agr;SIP molecule consisted of a single chain antibody (scFv) specific for the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) linked to the α‐CH3 domain from human IgA. To express the full‐length IgA, the individual light and heavy chains from the TGEV‐specific mAb 6A.C3 were inserted into separate PVX constructs and plants were co‐infected with both constructs. Western blot analysis revealed the efficient expression of both the SIP and IgA molecules. Analysis of crude plant extracts revealed that both the plant‐expressed αSIP and IgA molecules could bind to and neutralize TGEV in tissue culture, indicating that active molecules were produced. Oral administration of crude extracts from antibody‐expressing plant tissue to 2‐day‐old piglets showed that both the αSIP and full‐length IgA molecules can provide in vivo protection against TGEV.","biotechnology"
"BackgroundImmunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) offers safe interventions for the prevention of infection in patients after organ transplantation and for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases. MAb 201 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)–specific MAb that prevents establishment of viral replication in vitro and prevents viral replication in vivo when administered prophylactically. The efficacy of MAb 201 in the treatment of SARS was evaluated in golden Syrian hamsters, an animal model that supports SARS-CoV replication to high levels and displays severe pathological changes associated with infection, including pneumonitis and pulmonary consolidation MethodsGolden Syrian hamsters that were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV were treated with various doses of MAb 201 or an irrelevant MAb 24 h after inoculation. Two to 7 days after infection, the hamsters were killed, and their lungs were collected for evaluation of viral titers and pathological findings ResultsPostexposure treatment with MAb 201 can alleviate the viral burden and associated pathological findings in a golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV infection. After a hamster is treated with MAb 201, its viral burden is reduced by 102.4–103.9 50% tissue-culture infectious doses per gram of tissue, and the severity of associated pathological findings, including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation, is also remarkably reduced ConclusionsThe demonstration of successful postexposure MAb 201 therapy in an animal model that demonstrates viral replication and associated pulmonary pathological findings suggests that MAb 201 may be useful in the arsenal of tools to combat SARS","microbiology"
"Severe human disease associated with influenza A H5N1 virus was first detected in Hong Kong in 1997. Its recent reemergence in Asia and high associated mortality highlight the need to understand its pathogenesis. We investigated the roles of death receptor ligands (DRLs) in H5N1 infection. Significant up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-α, but not Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA, was detected in human monocyte–derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with avian influenza viruses A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1/97) or its precursor, A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97. H5N1/97-infected MDMs exhibited the strongest induction of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, and it could be reduced by TRAIL–receptor 2 blocking antibody. Furthermore, influenza virus infection enhanced the sensitivity of Jurkat T cells to apoptosis induced by TNF-α, TRAIL, and FasL. Our data suggested that functional TRAIL produced by influenza virus–infected MDMs was related to their cytotoxicity and that the enhanced sensitization to DRL-induced apoptosis detected in avian influenza may contribute to disease pathogenesis","microbiology"
"The SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase is considered as a potential drug design target for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Owing to the lack of available drugs for the treatment of SARS, the discovery of inhibitors for SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase that can potentially be optimized as drugs appears to be highly desirable. We have built a “flexible” three-dimensional model for SARS 3C-like proteinase by homology modeling and multicanonical molecular dynamics method and used the model for virtual screening of chemical databases. After Dock procedures, strategies including pharmocophore model, consensus scoring, and “drug-like” filters were applied in order to accelerate the process and improve the success rate of virtual docking screening hit lists. Forty compounds were purchased and tested by HPLC and colorimetric assay against SARS 3C-like proteinase. Three of them including calmidazolium, a well-known antagonist of calmodulin, were found to inhibit the enzyme with an apparent Ki from 61 to 178 μM. These active compounds and their binding modes provide useful information for understanding the binding sites and for further selective drug design against SARS and other coronavirus.","computer"

"Infection by viruses having lipid-bilayer envelopes proceeds through fusion of the viral membrane with a membrane of the target cell. Viral 'fusion proteins' facilitate this process. They vary greatly in structure, but all seem to have a common mechanism of action, in which a ligand-triggered, large-scale conformational change in the fusion protein is coupled to apposition and merger of the two bilayers. We describe three examples—the influenza virus hemagglutinin, the flavivirus E protein and the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein—in some detail, to illustrate the ways in which different structures have evolved to implement this common mechanism. Fusion inhibitors can be effective antiviral agents.","cell"
"Computational identification of ribosomal frameshift sites in genomic sequences is difficult due to their diverse nature, yet it provides useful information for understanding the underlying mechanisms and discovering new genes. We have developed an algorithm that searches entire genomic or mRNA sequences for frameshifting sites, and implements the algorithm as a web-based program called FSFinder (Frameshift Signal Finder). The current version of FSFinder is capable of finding −1 frameshift sites on heptamer sequences X XXY YYZ, and +1 frameshift sites for two genes: protein chain release factor B (prfB) and ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (oaz). We tested FSFinder on ∼190 genomic and partial DNA sequences from a number of organisms and found that it predicted frameshift sites efficiently and with greater sensitivity and specificity than existing approaches. It has improved sensitivity because it considers many known components of a frameshifting cassette and searches these components on both + and − strands, and its specificity is increased because it focuses on overlapping regions of open reading frames and prioritizes candidate frameshift sites. FSFinder is useful for discovering unknown genes that utilize alternative decoding, as well as for analyzing frameshift sites. It is freely accessible at http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/FSFinder/.","biochemistry"

Ribavirin is currently used for the treatment of several RNA virus infections clinically, so its anti-EV71 efficacy was evaluated. In vitro results showed that ribavirin effectively reduced the viral yields (with an IC50 of 65 μg/mL) and virus-induced cytopathic effect in human and mouse cell lines. In vivo results showed that ribavirin reduced the mortality, morbidity, and subsequent paralysis sequelae in infected mice by decreasing viral loads in tissues.

"Background The 2005 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) do not include a statement on performance of basic life support by a single healthcare professional using a bag–valve–mask device. Three positions are possible: chest compressions and ventilations from over the head of the casualty (over-the-head CPR), from the side of the casualty (lateral CPR), and chest compressions from the side and ventilations from over the head of the casualty (alternating CPR). The aim of this study was to compare CPR quality of these three positions. Methods 102 healthcare professionals were randomised to a crossover design and performed a 2-min CPR test on a manikin for each position. Results The hands-off time over a 2-min interval was not significantly different between over-the-head (median 31 s) and lateral (31 s) CPR, but these compared favourably with alternating CPR (36 s). Over-the-head CPR resulted in significantly more chest compressions (155) compared with lateral (152) and alternating CPR (149); the number of correct chest compressions did not differ significantly (119 vs 122 vs 109). Alternating CPR resulted in significantly less inflations (eight) compared with over-the-head (ten) and lateral CPR (ten). Lateral CPR led to significantly less correct inflations (three) compared with over-the-head (five) and alternating CPR (four). Conclusions In the case of a single healthcare professional using a bag–valve–mask device, the quality of over-the-head CPR is at least equivalent to lateral, and superior to alternating CPR. Because of the potential difficulties in bag–valve–mask ventilation in the lateral position, the authors recommend over-the-head CPR.","emergency"
"The expression of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) by immune and tissue cells provides the host with the ability to detect and respond to infection by viruses and other microorganisms. Significant progress has been made from studying this area, including the identification of PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors, and the description of the molecular basis of their signalling pathways, which lead to the production of interferons and other cytokines. In parallel, common mechanisms used by viruses to evade PRR-mediated responses or to actively subvert these pathways for their own benefit are emerging. Accumulating evidence on how viral infection and PRR signalling pathways intersect is providing further insights into the function of the pathways involved, their constituent proteins and ways in which they could be manipulated therapeutically.","immunology"
"Viral life cycle as that of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) completely relies on host cell infrastructure, presupposing that the virus has evolved mechanisms to utilize and control all cellular molecules or pathways required for viral life cycle. Hence, HCV must have acquired the ability to gain access to key pathways controlling processes, such as cell growth, apoptosis and protein synthesis, which are all considered to also be crucial for liver regeneration. This occurs in a balanced way permitting persistent replication of viral genomes and production of infectious particles without endangering host cell viability and survival. In particular during the last decade, accumulating evidence indicates that HCV utilizes signaling pathways of the host with major impact on cellular growth, viability, cell cycle or cellular metabolism, such as epidermal growth factor-receptor mediated signals, the PI3K/Akt cascade or the family of Src kinases. Furthermore, HCV specifically interacts with parts of the cellular machinery involved in protein translation, processing, maturation and transport, such as components of the translation complex, the heat shock protein family, the immunophilins or the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins A and B. The present review focuses on the interplay between viral proteins and these factors of the host cell enabling the virus to utilize host cell infrastructure.","biochemistry"
"Motivation: Heterochronous gene sequence data is important for characterizing the evolutionary processes of fast-evolving organisms such as RNA viruses. A limited set of algorithms exists for estimating the rate of nucleotide substitution and inferring phylogenetic trees from such data. The authors here present a new method, Tree and Rate Estimation by Local Evaluation (TREBLE) that robustly calculates the rate of nucleotide substitution and phylogeny with several orders of magnitude improvement in computational time. Methods: For the basis of its rate estimation TREBLE novelly utilizes a geometric interpretation of the molecular clock assumption to deduce a local estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution for triplets of dated sequences. Averaging the triplet estimates via a variance weighting yields a global estimate of the rate. From this value, an iterative refinement procedure relying on statistical properties of the triplets then generates a final estimate of the global rate of nucleotide substitution. The estimated global rate is then utilized to find the tree from the pairwise distance matrix via an UPGMA-like algorithm. Results: Simulation studies show that TREBLE estimates the rate of nucleotide substitution with point estimates comparable with the best of available methods. Confidence intervals are comparable with that of BEAST. TREBLE's phylogenetic reconstruction is significantly improved over the other distance matrix method but not as accurate as the Bayesian algorithm. Compared with three other algorithms, TREBLE reduces computational time by a minimum factor of 3000. Relative to the algorithm with the most accurate estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution (i.e. BEAST), TREBLE is over 10 000 times more computationally efficient.

"Abstract  Abstract  This study investigated the feasibility of using the spatial distribution of expiratory aerosols and the viability functions of airborne viruses to estimate exposures to airborne viruses in an indoor environment under imperfectly mixed condition. A method adopting this approach was tested in an air‐conditioned hospital ward. Artificial coughs were produced by aerosolizing a simulated respiratory fluid containing a known concentration of benign bacteriophage. The bacteriophage exposures estimated on the basis of the spatial aerosol distributions and its viability function were in reasonable agreement with those measured directly by biological air sampling and culturing. The ventilation flow and coughing orientation were found to play significant roles in aerosol transport, leading to different spatial distribution patterns in bacteriophage exposure. Bacteriophage exposures decreased with lateral distance from the infector when the infector coughed vertically upward. In contrast, exposures were constant or even increased with distance in the case of lateral coughing. The possibility of incorporating the proposed exposure estimation into a dose–response model for infection risk assessment was discussed. The study has also demonstrated the potential application of viability functions of airborne viral pathogens in exposure assessment and infection risk analysis, which are often unavailable in literature for some important communicable diseases.","public"
"Abstract  Abstract  Quick information on airborne infectious disease transmission in airliner cabins is essential to reduce the risk of infection of passengers and crew members. This investigation proposed a one‐dimensional analytical model that can predict the longitudinal transmission of airborne contaminants or disease viruses inside an airliner cabin. The model considered both diffusive and convective transport of contaminants in the longitudinal direction of the cabin but assumed complete mixing of contaminants in the cabin cross‐section. The effect of recirculation of the cabin air and efficiency of the high‐efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters is also considered in the model. The analytical solution for the one‐dimensional contaminant transport model is obtained by using the principle of superposition and the method of separation of variables. The analytical solutions agree well with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results. The coupling of a CFD model with the one‐dimensional analytical model could capture the impact of local airflow on contaminant transport. This analytical model has been used for analyzing contaminant transport in a 30‐row all‐economy‐class airliner cabin with minimal computing effort.","public"

"Viruses are obligatory intracellular parasites that require the host machinery to replicate. During their replication cycle, viral RNA intermediates can be recognized and degraded by different antiviral mechanisms that include RNA decay, RNA interference, and RNase L pathways. As a consequence of viral RNA degradation, infected cells can accumulate virus‐derived small RNAs at high levels compared to cellular molecules. These small RNAs are imprinted with molecular characteristics that reflect their origin. First, small RNAs can be used to reconstruct viral sequences and identify the virus from which they originated. Second, other molecular features of small RNAs such as size, polarity, and base preferences depend on the type of viral substrate and host mechanism of degradation. Thus, the pattern of small RNAs generated in infected cells can be used as a molecular footprint to identify and characterize viruses independent on sequence homology searches against known references. Hence, sequencing of small RNAs obtained from infected cells enables virus discovery and characterization using both sequence‐dependent strategies and novel pattern‐based approaches. Recent studies are helping unlock the full application of small RNA sequencing for virus discovery and characterization.

"Highly conserved noncoding RNA (ncRNA) elements in viral genomes and transcripts offer new opportunities to expand the repertoire of drug targets for the development of antiinfective therapy. Ligands binding to ncRNA architectures are able to affect interactions, structural stability or conformational changes and thereby block processes essential for viral replication. Proof of concept for targeting functional RNA by small molecule inhibitors has been demonstrated for multiple viruses with RNA genomes. Strategies to identify antiviral compounds as inhibitors of ncRNA are increasingly emphasizing consideration of drug‐like properties of candidate molecules emerging from screening and ligand design. Recent efforts of antiviral lead discovery for RNA targets have provided drug‐like small molecules that inhibit viral replication and include inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), and influenza A virus. While target selectivity remains a challenge for the discovery of useful RNA‐binding compounds, a better understanding is emerging of properties that define RNA targets amenable for inhibition by small molecule ligands. Insight from successful approaches of targeting viral ncRNA in HIV, HCV, SARS CoV, and influenza A will provide a basis for the future exploration of RNA targets for therapeutic intervention in other viral pathogens which create urgent, unmet medical needs. Viruses for which targeting ncRNA components in the genome or transcripts may be promising include insect‐borne flaviviruses (Dengue, Zika, and West Nile) and filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg).

"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem worldwide. The main clinical limitation of a current antiviral drug for HBV, lamivudine, is the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains upon prolonged therapy. A group of 5-, 6-, or 5,6-substituted acyclic pyrimidine nucleosides with a 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl] moiety were synthesized and evaluated for antiviral activities. The target compounds were prepared by the reaction of silylated uracils possessing a variety of substituents at the C-5 or C-6 positions or both with 1,3-dioxolane in the presence of potassium iodide and chlorotrimethylsilane by a convenient and single-step synthesis. Among the compounds tested, 5-chloro and 5-bromo analogues possessing an acyclic glycosyl moiety were the most effective and selective antiviral agents in the in vitro assays against wild-type duck HBV (EC50 = 0.4−2.2 and 3.7−18.5 μM, respectively) and human HBV-containing 2.2.15 cells (EC50 = 4.5−45.4 and 18.5−37.7 μM, respectively). These compounds were also found to retain sensitivity against lamivudine-resistant HBV containing a single mutation (M204I) and double mutations (L180M/M204V). The compounds investigated did not show cytotoxicity to host HepG2 and Vero cells, up to the highest concentration tested. The results presented here confirm and accentuate the potential of acyclic pyrimidine nucleosides as anti-HBV agents and extend our previous observations.

"A novel class of aminoisonucleoside was synthesized and incorporated into a luciferase gene-targeting siRNA. Structural and functional analyses of such a kind of siRNAs indicated that sense strand modifications with aminoisonucleoside at the 3‘ or 5‘ terminal, such as ssIso-1 and ssIso-2, have less effect on RNA duplex thermal and serum stabilities, and their functional activities are also comparable to their native siRNAs. In contrast, antisense strand modifications with aminoisonucleoside at the corresponding positions, such as asIso-2 or asIso-1, bring a striking negative effect on RNA duplex stability but still maintain around 40−50% of gene knockdown.","chemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp1 protein suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and inhibiting host translation, in infected cells. We present evidence that nsp1 uses a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation and gene expression. Nsp1 bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit and inactivated the translational activity of the 40S subunits. Furthermore, the nsp1–40S ribosome complex induced the modification of the 5′ region of capped mRNA template and rendered the template RNA translationally incompetent. Nsp1 also induced RNA cleavage in templates carrying the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus, but not in those carrying IRES elements from hepatitis C or cricket paralysis viruses, demonstrating that the nsp1-induced RNA modification was template-dependent. We speculate that the mRNAs that underwent the nsp1-mediated modification are marked for rapid turnover by the host RNA degradation machinery.","cell"
"C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) expressed by dendritic cells are crucial for tailoring immune responses to pathogens. Following pathogen binding, CLRs trigger distinct signalling pathways that induce the expression of specific cytokines which determine T cell polarization fates. Some CLRs can induce signalling pathways that directly activate nuclear factor-κB, whereas other CLRs affect signalling by Toll-like receptors. Dissecting these signalling pathways and their effects on host immune cells is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of adaptive immune responses. In this Review we describe the role of CLR signalling in regulating adaptive immunity and immunopathogenesis and discuss how this knowledge can be harnessed for the development of innovative vaccination approaches.","immunology"
"Motivation: Processing and presentation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes is crucial for immune surveillance against intracellular bacteria, parasites, viruses and tumors. Identification of antigenic regions on pathogen proteins will play a pivotal role in designer vaccine immunotherapy. We have developed a system that not only identifies high binding T-cell antigenic epitopes, but also class I T-cell antigenic clusters termed immunological hot spots. Methods: MULTIPRED, a computational system for promiscuous prediction of HLA class I binders, uses artificial neural networks (ANN) and hidden Markov models (HMM) as predictive engines. The models were rigorously trained, tested and validated using experimentally identified HLA class I T-cell epitopes from human melanoma related proteins and human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7. We have developed a scoring scheme for identification of immunological hot spots for HLA class I molecules, which is the sum of the highest four predictions within a window of 30 amino acids. Results: Our predictions against experimental data from four melanoma-related proteins showed that MULTIPRED ANN and HMM models could predict T-cell epitopes with high accuracy. The analysis of proteins E6 and E7 showed that ANN models appear to be more accurate for prediction of HLA-A3 hot spots and HMM models for HLA-A2 predictions. For illustration of its utility we applied MULTIPRED for prediction of promiscuous T-cell epitopes in all four SARS coronavirus structural proteins. MULTIPRED predicted HLA-A2 and HLA-A3 hot spots in each of these proteins.","mathematical"
"Cathepsin D is a major component of lysosomes and plays a major role in catabolism and degenerative diseases. The quantitative structure–activity relationship study was used to explore the critical chemical features of cathepsin D inhibitors. Top 10 hypotheses were built based on 36 known cathepsin D inhibitors using HypoGen/Discovery Studio v2.5. The best hypothesis Hypo1 consists of three hydrophobic, one hydrogen bond acceptor lipid, and one hydrogen bond acceptor features. The selected Hypo1 model was cross‐validated using Fischer’s randomization method to identify the strong correlation between experimental and predicted activity value as well as the test set and decoy sets used to validate its predictability. Moreover, the best hypothesis was used as a 3D query in virtual screening of Scaffold database. Subsequently, the screened hit molecules were filtered by applying Lipinski’s rule of five, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and toxicity, and molecular docking studies. Finally, 49 compounds were obtained as potent cathepsin D inhibitors based on the consensus scoring values, critical interactions with protein active site residues, and predicted activity values. Thus, we suggest that the application of Hypo1 could assist in the selection of potent cathepsin D leads from various databases. Hence, this model was used as a valuable tool to design new candidate for cathepsin D inhibitors.","chemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), a protein required for the maturation of SARS-CoV, is vital for its life cycle, making it an attractive target for structure-based drug design of anti-SARS drugs. The structure-based virtual screening of a chemical database containing 58 855 compounds followed by the testing of potential compounds for SARS-CoV Mpro inhibition leads to two hit compounds. The core structures of these two hits, defined by the docking study, are used for further analogue search. Twenty-one analogues derived from these two hits exhibited IC50 values below 50 μM, with the most potent one showing 0.3 μM. Furthermore, the complex structures of two potent inhibitors with SARS-CoV Mpro were solved by X-ray crystallography. They bind to the protein in a distinct manner compared to all published SARS-CoV Mpro complex structures. They inhibit SARS-CoV Mpro activity via intensive H-bond network and hydrophobic interactions, without the formation of a covalent bond. Interestingly, the most potent inhibitor induces protein conformational changes, and the inhibition mechanisms, particularly the disruption of catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145), are elaborated.","chemistry"

"BACKGROUND: The recent H1N1 pandemic provided an opportunity to conceptually assess the possibility of rapidly providing a “hyperimmune” human immunoglobulin (H‐IVIG) to an emerging infectious disease, in useful quantities with respect to public health. Commercial‐scale H‐IVIG production from plasma collected from donors convalescent from or vaccinated against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A special protocol was implemented for the collection, processing, and shipment of plasma from previously qualified source plasma donors, self‐identifying as convalescent from or vaccinated against H1N1 influenza. A licensed IVIG manufacturing process was utilized for the preparation of two commercial lots of approximately 50 kg 10% human IVIG preparation in total. The H1N1 hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization antibody titers of the resulting H‐IVIG preparations were determined and compared with standard preparations. RESULTS: Twenty‐six plasma collection centers participated in the protocol. Donor enrollment exceeded 300 donors per week and within 30 days of protocol deployment plasma was being collected at a rate of more than 2000 L/week. Manufacture of both H‐IVIG lots was unremarkable and both lots met the requirements for commercial release and the bulk of the product was distributed in normal commercial channels. Examination of plasma pools and final IVIG product confirmed pandemic H1N1 antibody titers substantially higher than those collected before the emergence of the pandemic H1N1 virus. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the feasibility of producing a H‐IVIG preparation at large scale relatively rapidly, with a significant enrichment in antibodies to the H1N1 influenza, achieved by donor self‐identification.","hematology"
"Respiratory infections after air travel are frequent, but epidemiological data are incomplete. Using sensitive polymerase chain reactions, we studied the spectrum of atypical bacteria and respiratory viruses in travelers fulfilling the case definition of severe acute respiratory syndrome. A pathogen was identified in 67 travelers (43.2%). Influenza and parainfluenza viruses were most prevalent, at 14.2% and 15.5%, respectively. Prevalences of adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses ranged between 2.6% and 4.8%. Human bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Legionella, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydophila species were absent or appeared at frequencies of <1%. To our knowledge, these are the first specific baseline data for the mentioned agents in the context of air travel.","microbiology"
"Hong Kong experienced an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) from March to June 2003. Nursing homes were a potential area of cross‐infection because of the crowded living space, substandard environmental hygiene, inadequate ventilation, low working staff to resident ratio, and staff who lacked knowledge of infection control. The mortality in elderly SARS patients was high because of their atypical presentations, their multiple comorbidities, and that they are more susceptible to the side‐effects of treatment. The community geriatric assessment team need to work closely with the hospitals and the primary health care system to provide surveillance of the disease, infection control, and management of sub‐acute clinical problems, in order to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions in nursing home residents during an epidemic outbreak.","gerontology"
"The BAG family of Hsp70/Hsc70 co‐chaperones is characterised by the presence of a conserved BAG domain at the carboxyl‐terminus. BAG3 protein is the only member of this family containing also the N‐terminally located WW domain. We describe here the identification of adenovirus (Ad) penton base protein as the first BAG3 partner recognising BAG3 WW domain. Ad penton base is the viral capsid constituent responsible for virus internalisation. It contains in the N‐terminal part two conserved PPxY motifs, known ligands of WW domains. In cells producing Ad penton base protein, cytoplasmic endogenous BAG3 interacts with it and co‐migrates to the nucleus. Preincubation of BAG3 with Ad base protein results in only slight modulation of BAG3 co‐chaperone activity, suggesting that this interaction is not related to the classical BAG3 co‐chaperone function. However, depletion of BAG3 impairs the cell entry of the virus and viral progeny production in Ad‐infected cells, suggesting that the interaction between virus penton base protein and cellular co‐chaperone BAG3 positively influences virus life cycle. These results thus demonstrate a novel host–pathogen interaction, which contributes to the successful infectious life cycle of adenoviruses. In addition, these data enrich our knowledge about the multifunctionality of the BAG3 co‐chaperone. J. Cell. Biochem. 111: 699–708, 2010. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","cell"
"Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal method to amplify nucleic acid sequences without the temperature cycling that classical PCR uses. Instead of using heat to denature the DNA duplex, RPA uses recombination enzymes to swap single‐stranded primers into the duplex DNA product; these are then extended using a strand‐displacing polymerase to complete the cycle. Because RPA runs at low temperatures, it never forces the system to recreate base‐pairs following Watson–Crick rules, and therefore it produces undesired products that impede the amplification of the desired product, complicating downstream analysis. Herein, we show that most of these undesired side products can be avoided if the primers contain components of a self‐avoiding molecular recognition system (SAMRS). Given the precision that is necessary in the recombination systems for them to function biologically, it is surprising that they accept SAMRS. SAMRS‐RPA is expected to be a powerful tool within the range of amplification techniques available to scientists.","chemistry"

"The coronavirus main protease, Mpro, is considered to be a major target for drugs suitable for combating coronavirus infections including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). An HPLC-based screening of electrophilic compounds that was performed to identify potential Mpro inhibitors revealed etacrynic acid tert-butylamide (6a) as an effective nonpeptidic inhibitor. Docking studies suggested a binding mode in which the phenyl ring acts as a spacer bridging the inhibitor's activated double bond and its hydrophobic tert-butyl moiety. The latter is supposed to fit into the S4 pocket of the target protease. Furthermore, these studies revealed etacrynic acid amide (6b) as a promising lead for nonpeptidic active-site-directed Mpro inhibitors. In a fluorimetric enzyme assay using a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair labeled substrate, compound 6b showed a Ki value of 35.3 μM. Since the novel lead compound does not target the S1‘, S1, and S2 subsites of the enzyme's substrate-binding pockets, there is room for improvement that underlines the lead character of compound 6b.","chemistry"

"Current treatment schemes for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) include broad-spectrum antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and ribavirin. We evaluated the susceptibility of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) to ribavirin and interferon (IFN)-α in vitro by use of cytopathic effect, plaque assay, and immunoblot analysis. Ribavirin did not inhibit viral growth at concentrations attainable in human serum. In contrast, IFN-α showed an in vitro inhibitory effect starting at concentrations of 1000 IU/mL. In conclusion, ribavirin alone is unlikely to be beneficial in the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS CoV infections. Clinical trials with IFN-α might be justified to determine a beneficial effect on the outcome of SARS.","microbiology"
"While ribosomes must maintain translational reading frame in order to translate primary genetic information into polypeptides, cis‐acting signals located in mRNAs represent higher order information content that can be used to fine‐tune gene expression. Classes of signals have been identified that direct a fraction of elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by one base in the 5′ (−1) or 3′ (+1) direction. This is called programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). Although mechanisms of PRF differ, a common feature is induction of ribosome pausing, which alters kinetic partitioning rates between in‐frame and out‐of‐frame codons at specific ‘slippery’ sequences. Many viruses use PRF to ensure synthesis of the correct ratios of virus‐encoded proteins required for proper viral particle assembly and maturation, thus identifying PRF as an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. In contrast, recent studies indicate that PRF signals may primarily function as mRNA destabilizing elements in cellular mRNAs. These studies suggest that PRF may be used to fine‐tune gene expression through mRNA decay pathways. The possible regulation of PRF by noncoding RNAs is also discussed.

"RNA viruses are ubiquitous in nature, infecting every known organism on the planet. These viruses can also be notorious human pathogens with significant medical and economic burdens. Central to the lifecycle of an RNA virus is the synthesis of new RNA molecules, a process that is mediated by specialized virally encoded enzymes called RNA‐dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). RdRps directly catalyze phosphodiester bond formation between nucleoside triphosphates in an RNA‐templated manner. These enzymes are strikingly conserved in their structural and functional features, even among diverse RNA viruses belonging to different families. During host cell infection, the activities of viral RdRps are often regulated by viral cofactor proteins. Cofactors can modulate the type and timing of RNA synthesis by directly engaging the RdRp and/or by indirectly affecting its capacity to recognize template RNA. High‐resolution structures of RdRps as apoenzymes, bound to RNA templates, in the midst of catalysis, and/or interacting with regulatory cofactor proteins, have dramatically increased our understanding of viral RNA synthetic mechanisms. Combined with elegant biochemical studies, such structures are providing a scientific platform for the rational design of antiviral agents aimed at preventing and treating RNA virus‐induced diseases.

"Recent studies indicate that the mechanism of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) organogenesis is different from that of other lymphoid tissues. NALT has an important role in the induction of mucosal immune responses, including the generation of T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells, and IgA-committed B cells. Moreover, intranasal immunization can lead to the induction of antigen-specific protective immunity in both the mucosal and systemic immune compartments. Therefore, a greater understanding of the differences between NALT and other organized lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer's patches, should facilitate the development of nasal vaccines.","immunology"
"HIV TAR RNA‐binding protein (TRBP) and Protein Activator of PKR (PACT) are double‐stranded (ds) RNA‐binding proteins that participate in both small regulatory RNA biogenesis and the response to viral dsRNA. Despite considerable progress toward understanding the structure–function relationship of TRBP and PACT, their specific roles in these seemingly distinct cellular pathways remain unclear. Both proteins are composed of three copies of the double‐stranded RNA‐binding domain, two of which interact with dsRNA, while the C‐terminal copy mediates protein–protein interactions. PACT and TRBP are found in a complex with the endonuclease Dicer and facilitate processing of immature microRNAs. Their precise contribution to the Dicing step has not yet been defined: possibilities include precursor recruitment, rearrangement of dsRNA within the complex, loading the processed microRNA into the RNA‐induced silencing complex, and distinguishing different classes of small dsRNA. TRBP and PACT also interact with the viral dsRNA sensors retinoic acid‐inducible gene I (RIG‐I) and double‐stranded RNA‐activated protein kinase (PKR). Current models suggest that PACT enables RIG‐I to detect a wider range of viral dsRNAs, while TRBP and PACT exert opposing regulatory effects on PKR. Here, the evidence that implicates TRBP and PACT in regulatory RNA processing and viral dsRNA sensing is reviewed and discussed in the context of their molecular structure. The broader implications of a link between microRNA biogenesis and the innate antiviral response pathway are also considered.

"The purpose of this study was to determine the physical collection efficiency of commercially available filters for collecting airborne bacteria, viruses, and other particles in the 10–900 nm (nanometer) size range. Laboratory experiments with various polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC) and gelatin filters in conjunction with Button™ Inhalable samplers and three-piece cassettes were undertaken. Both biological and non-biological test aerosols were used: Bacillus atrophaeus, MS2, polystyrene latex (PSL), and sodium chloride (NaCl). The B.atrophaeus endospores had an aerodynamic diameter of 900 nm, whereas MS2 virion particles ranged from 10 to 80 nm. Monodisperse 350 nm PSL particles were used as this size was believed to have the lowest filtration efficiency. NaCl solution (1% weight by volume) was used to create a polydisperse aerosol in the 10–600 nm range. The physical collection efficiency was determined by measuring particle concentrations size-selectively upstream and downstream of the filters. The PTFE and gelatin filters showed excellent collection efficiency (>93%) for all of the test particles. The PC filters showed lower collection efficiency for small particles especially <100 nm. Among the tested filters, the lowest collection efficiencies, 49 and 22%, were observed for 1 and 3-μm pore size PC filters at the particle sizes of 47 and 63 nm, respectively. The results indicate that the effect of filter material is more significant for the size range of single virions than for bacteria. The effect of filter loading was examined by exposing filters to mixtures of PSL particles, which aimed at mimicking typical indoor dust levels and size distributions. A 4-h loading did not cause significant change in the physical collection efficiency of the tested filters.","public"
"Ebola virus is a highly virulent pathogen capable of inducing a frequently lethal hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Accumulating evidence indicates that the virus actively subverts both innate and adaptive immune responses and triggers harmful inflammatory responses as it inflicts direct tissue damage. The host immune system is ultimately overwhelmed by a combination of inflammatory factors and virus-induced cell damage, particularly in the liver and vasculature, often leading to death from septic shock. We summarize the mechanisms of immune dysregulation and virus-mediated cell damage in Ebola virus–infected patients. Future approaches to prevention and treatment of infection will be guided by answers to unresolved questions about interspecies transmission, molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, and protective adaptive and innate immune responses to Ebola virus.","immunology"
"Little is known about the innate immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) infection. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a key molecule in innate immunity, functions as an ante-antibody before the specific antibody response. Here, we describe a case-control study that included 569 patients with SARS and 1188 control subjects and used in vitro assays to investigate the role that MBL plays in SARS-CoV infection. The distribution of MBL gene polymorphisms was significantly different between patients with SARS and control subjects, with a higher frequency of haplotypes associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL in patients with SARS than in control subjects. Serum levels of MBL were also significantly lower in patients with SARS than in control subjects. There was, however, no association between MBL genotypes, which are associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL, and mortality related to SARS. MBL could bind SARS-CoV in a dose- and calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion in vitro, suggesting that binding is through the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL. Furthermore, deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV was enhanced by MBL. Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL in fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK-4) was also observed. These results suggest that MBL contributes to the first-line host defense against SARS-CoV and that MBL deficiency is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS","microbiology"
"Motivation: Recently, the concept of the constrained sequence alignment was proposed to incorporate the knowledge of biologists about structures/functionalities/consensuses of their datasets into sequence alignment such that the user-specified residues/nucleotides are aligned together in the computed alignment. The currently developed programs use the so-called progressive approach to efficiently obtain a constrained alignment of several sequences. However, the kernels of these programs, the dynamic programming algorithms for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, run in 𝒪(γn 2) memory, where γ is the number of the constraints and n is the maximum of the lengths of sequences. As a result, such a high memory requirement limits the overall programs to align short sequences~only. Results: We adopt the divide-and-conquer approach to design a memory-efficient algorithm for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, which greatly reduces the memory requirement of the dynamic programming approaches at the expense of a small constant factor in CPU time. This new algorithm consumes only 𝒪(αn) space, where α is the sum of the lengths of constraints and usually α ≪ n in practical applications. Based on this algorithm, we have developed a memory-efficient tool for multiple sequence alignment with constraints.

"New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses are rodent-borne agents that cause severe human disease. The GP1 subunit of the surface glycoprotein mediates cell attachment through transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). We report the structure of Machupo virus (MACV) GP1 bound with human TfR1. Atomic details of the GP1-TfR1 interface clarify the importance of TfR1 residues implicated in New World arenavirus host specificity. Analysis of sequence variation among New World arenavirus GP1s and their host-species receptors, in light of the molecular structure, indicates determinants of viral zoonotic transmission. Infectivities of pseudoviruses in cells expressing mutated TfR1 confirm that contacts at the tip of the TfR1 apical domain determine the capacity of human TfR1 to mediate infection by particular New World arenaviruses. We propose that New World arenaviruses that are pathogenic to humans fortuitously acquired affinity for human TfR1 during adaptation to TfR1 of their natural hosts.","cell"
"At the end of 2002, the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were reported, and in the following year, SARS resulted in considerable mortality and morbidity worldwide. SARS is caused by a novel species of coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is the most severe coronavirus-mediated human disease that has been described so far. On the basis of similarities with other coronavirus infections, SARS might, in part, be immune mediated. As discussed in this Review, studies of animals that are infected with other coronaviruses indicate that excessive and sometimes dysregulated responses by macrophages and other pro-inflammatory cells might be particularly important in the pathogenesis of disease that is caused by infection with these viruses. It is hoped that lessons from such studies will help us to understand more about the pathogenesis of SARS in humans and to prevent or control outbreaks of SARS in the future.","immunology"
"Aims.  This paper reports a study which aimed to: (1) investigate the relationship between nurses’ commitment to the nursing profession and organization and their intention to leave; (2) investigate nurses’ perceptions of the possibility of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome infection and its moderation of their commitment to the nursing profession and the organization and their consequent intentions to leave the profession and the organization following the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Background.  The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 resulted in a fatality rate of approximately 11%. Nurses in hospitals caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome maintained close contact with the infected patients. The high risk of infection and death associated with caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome had a great impact on nurse retention in hospitals. Nurse turnover in many countries where these outbreaks occurred has been high since the first outbreak occurred in March 2003. Methods.  Three hundred and thirty nurses working at a Taiwan hospital during the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak completed the Meyer, Allen & Smith Organizational and Occupational Commitment Scales, Intention to Leave and Perceived Stress of Infection Scales between July and August 2003. Results.  All three components of occupational and organizational commitments were negatively associated with nurses’ intentions to leave the nursing profession and the organization. Nurses’ perceptions of the possibility of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome infection through caring for these patients had a moderating effect on the relationship between commitment and the intention to leave. Conclusions.  Perceived risk to life from infection has a possible influence on the commitment/intention‐to‐leave model in hospital nurses caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, and this information can inform hospital and nursing managers about nurse retention following a severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and the management of commitment in the context of nursing human resources management.","nursing"
"Viruses are very small and most of them can be seen only by TEM (transmission electron microscopy). TEM has therefore made a major contribution to virology, including the discovery of many viruses, the diagnosis of various viral infections and fundamental investigations of virus—host cell interactions. However, TEM has gradually been replaced by more sensitive methods, such as the PCR. In research, new imaging techniques for fluorescence light microscopy have supplanted TEM, making it possible to study live cells and dynamic interactions between viruses and the cellular machinery. Nevertheless, TEM remains essential for certain aspects of virology. It is very useful for the initial identification of unknown viral agents in particular outbreaks, and is recommended by regulatory agencies for investigation of the viral safety of biological products and/or the cells used to produce them. In research, only TEM has a resolution sufficiently high for discrimination between aggregated viral proteins and structured viral particles. Recent examples of different viral assembly models illustrate the value of TEM for improving our understanding of virus—cell interactions.","cell"
"Motivation: The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in the form of the Baum–Welch algorithm (for hidden Markov models) or the Inside-Outside algorithm (for stochastic context-free grammars), is a powerful way to estimate the parameters of stochastic grammars for biological sequence analysis. To use this algorithm for multiple-sequence evolutionary modelling, it would be useful to apply the EM algorithm to estimate not only the probability parameters of the stochastic grammar, but also the instantaneous mutation rates of the underlying evolutionary model (to facilitate the development of stochastic grammars based on phylogenetic trees, also known as Statistical Alignment). Recently, we showed how to do this for the point substitution component of the evolutionary process; here, we extend these results to the indel process. Results: We present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of insertion and deletion rates from multiple sequence alignments, using EM, under the single-residue indel model owing to Thorne, Kishino and Felsenstein (the ‘TKF91’ model). The algorithm converges extremely rapidly, gives accurate results on simulated data that are an improvement over parsimonious estimates (which are shown to underestimate the true indel rate), and gives plausible results on experimental data (coronavirus envelope domains). Owing to the algorithm's close similarity to the Baum–Welch algorithm for training hidden Markov models, it can be used in an ‘unsupervised’ fashion to estimate rates for unaligned sequences, or estimate several sets of rates for sequences with heterogenous rates.

"Some microorganisms can grow in water while others merely survive. The use of the water may result in the creation of aerosols which can disseminate the products of microbial growth or the microorganisms themselves. In the home, toilets, sinks and showers can provide a reservoir for microorganisms to survive and grow. Intermittent use of disinfectants alone may not be adequate to control these microorganisms unless regular cleaning and brushing is practiced. Similar problems occur in hospitals, offices and public buildings. Here control is much more important. In these environments infections can potentially spread readily to large numbers of people from the creation of aerosols both in sanitary equipment and the sewerage system associated with it. Control is helped by regular cleaning but much more attention needs to be placed on proper construction, servicing and maintenance of the infrastructure. This article reviews the types of microorganisms associated with growth in water and with faecal material and how these organisms are spread. The nature and impact of the spread is illustrated with a number of published examples.","construction"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century that has been highly transmissible and fatal and was caused by a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). The SARS epidemic in 2003 resulted in more than 8400 SARS cases and approximately 800 deaths. Existing in non‐identified animal reservoirs, SARS‐CoV continues to represent a threat to humans although more than four years have passed since a large outbreak of SARS, and no new cases have been reported. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of reemergence of SARS. It is hence necessary to understand the biology of the SARS‐CoV to deal adequately with the next outbreak, whenever it happens. The SARS‐CoV is a novel coronavirus with a large (∼30 thousand nucleotides) positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA containing 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) of which 2 large ORFs constitute the replicase gene which encodes proteins required for viral RNA syntheses. The remaining 12 ORFs encode the 4 structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope; and eight accessory proteins. The viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergoes extensive translational and enzymatic processing to form the 4 structural, 8 accessory and 16 nonstructural proteins. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms or capsid assembly and viral pathogenesis, laboratories around the world have adopted a variety of approaches to answering these trivial questions. It has been our effort to consolidate all information known to date about the molecular mechanisms of the SARS‐CoV into this chapter to update our readership on the current status of research.","multidisciplinary"

The population dense regions of Southeast Asia are the epicenter of many emerging diseases, as evidenced by the outbreak of Nipah, SARS, avian influenza (H5N1), Dengue, and enterovirus 71 in this region in the past decade. Rapid identification, epidemiologic surveillance, and mitigation of transmission are major challenges in ensuring public health safety. Here we describe a powerful new approach for infectious disease surveillance that is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify nucleic acid targets from large groupings of organisms, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI‐MS) for accurate mass measurements of the PCR products, and base composition signature analysis to identify organisms in a sample. This approach is capable of automated analysis of more than 1,500 PCR reactions a day. It is applicable to the surveillance of bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal pathogens and will facilitate rapid characterization of known and emerging pathogens.","multidisciplinary"

A cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) thin film containing an additive such as2-(6-mercaptohexyl) malonic acid was prepared using a spin-coating process.Furthermore, attention was directed towards the processing conditions which werefound to have an important role and are related to the self-assembly and micelleformation behavior of the additives in the COC. In the present study, thin films of 13m thickness were charged by a corona method. Compared with areference thin film of pure COC, results indicated that when a 3497mgkg 1 additivewas added to the COC matrix, the obtained surface potential was 71 higher. Thus, the results show thata COC additive thin film leads to a much improved charge storage. It appears to be an inexpensiveand relatively easy way to form a thin structure for developing novel flexible electretloudspeakers.","materials"

However, the search for an efficient vaccine is still ongoing. One of the main problems is the presence of a continuously evolving dense carbohydrate shield, consisting of N‐linked glycans that surrounds the virion and protects it against efficient recognition and persistent neutralization by the immune system. However, several lectins from the innate immune system specifically bind to these glycans in an attempt to process the virus antigens to provoke an immune response. Across a wide variety of different species in nature lectins can be found that can interact with the glycosylated envelope of HIV‐1 and can block the infection of susceptible cells by the virus. In this review, we will give an overview of the lectins from non‐mammalian origin that are endowed with antiviral properties and discuss the complex interactions between lectins of the innate immune system and HIV‐1. Also, attention will be given to different carbohydrate‐related modalities that can be exploited for antiviral chemotherapy.  © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Med Res Rev","pharmacology"
"Human neutrophil elastase (NE) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease. Using high-throughput chemolibrary screening, we identified 10 N-benzoylpyrazole derivatives that were potent NE inhibitors. Nine additional NE inhibitors were identified through further screening of N-benzoylpyrazole analogues. Evaluation of inhibitory activity against a range of proteases showed high specificity for NE, although several derivatives were also potent inhibitors of chymotrypsin. Analysis of reaction kinetics and inhibitor stability revealed that N-benzoylpyrazoles were pseudoirreversible competitive inhibitors of NE. Structure−activity relationship (SAR) analysis demonstrated that modification of N-benzoylpyrazole ring substituents modulated enzyme selectivity and potency. Furthermore, molecular modeling of the binding of selected active and inactive compounds to the NE active site revealed that active compounds fit well into the catalytic site, whereas inactive derivatives contained substituents or conformations that hindered binding or accessibility to the catalytic residues. Thus, N-benzoylpyrazole derivatives represent novel structural templates that can be utilized for further development of efficacious NE inhibitors.","chemistry"
"Employees in different types of work may be intentionally or accidentally exposed to biological agents. Improved risk assessment is needed to identify opportunities to prevent work-related infectious disease. The objective of the current study was to perform a systematic literature review of work-related infectious disease to assist in the identification of occupational infectious disease risks. A literature search of papers on work-related infectious disease published between 1999 and 2008 yielded 1239 papers of which 242 met the selection criteria and were included in the review. The results of the systematic literature review were arranged in a matrix of occupational groups and exposure pathways. Increased risk from infectious diseases appeared to be concentrated in specific professions. Healthcare workers, workers in contact with animals, laboratory workers and refuse workers seem to have the highest risk of infection by a variety of pathogens. However, pathogens reported to be associated with closely related professions were different, indicating qualitative under-reporting. Arranging the results of this systematic review on work-related infectious diseases in a matrix of occupational groups and exposure pathways allowed the reliable identification of exposure hazards for specific occupational groups beyond currently reported diseases.","public"
"We developed a new tool to detect and identify hepatotoxin‐producing cyanobacteria of the genera Anabaena, Microcystis, Planktothrix, Nostoc and Nodularia. Genus‐specific probe pairs were designed for the detection of the microcystin (mcyE) and nodularin synthetase genes (ndaF) of these five genera to be used with a DNA‐chip. The method couples a ligation detection reaction, in which the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐amplified mcyE/ndaF genes are recognized by the probe pairs, with a hybridization on a universal microarray. All the probe pairs specifically detected the corresponding mcyE/ndaF gene sequences when DNA from the microcystin‐ or nodularin‐producing cyanobacterial strains were used as template in the PCR. Furthermore, the strict specificity of detection enabled identification of the potential hepatotoxin producers. Detection of the genes was very sensitive; only 1–5 fmol of the PCR product were needed to produce signal intensities that exceeded the set background threshold level. The genus‐specific probe pairs also reliably detected potential microcystin producers in DNA extracted from six lake and four brackish water samples. In lake samples, the same microcystin producers were identified with quantitative real‐time PCR analysis. The specificity, sensitivity and ability of the DNA‐chip in simultaneously detecting all the main hepatotoxin producers make this method suitable for high‐throughput analysis and monitoring of environmental samples.","microbiology"

"The 1918–1919 H1N1 influenza pandemic was among the most deadly events in recorded human history, killing an estimated 50–100 million persons. Because recent H5N1 avian epizootics have been associated with sporadic human fatalities, concern has been raised that a new pandemic, as fatal as the pandemic of 1918, or more so, could be developing. Understanding the events and experiences of 1918 is thus of great importance. However, despite the genetic sequencing of the entire genome of the 1918 virus, many questions about the 1918 pandemic remain. In this review we address several of these questions, concerning pandemic-virus origin, unusual epidemiologic features, and the causes and demographic patterns of fatality. That none of these questions can yet be fully answered points to the need for continued pandemic vigilance, basic and applied research, and pandemic preparedness planning that emphasizes prevention, containment, and treatment with antiviral medications and hospital-based intensive care.","microbiology"
"Three-dimensional (3D) structure is now known for a large fraction of all protein families. Thus, it has become rather likely that one will find a homolog with known 3D structure when searching a sequence database with an arbitrary query sequence. Depending on the extent of similarity, such neighbor relationships may allow one to infer biological function and to identify functional sites such as binding motifs or catalytic centers. Entrez's 3D-structure database, the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), provides easy access to the richness of 3D structure data and its large potential for functional annotation. Entrez's search engine offers several tools to assist biologist users: (i) links between databases, such as between protein sequences and structures, (ii) pre-computed sequence and structure neighbors, (iii) visualization of structure and sequence/structure alignment. Here, we describe an annotation service that combines some of these tools automatically, Entrez's ‘Related Structure’ links. For all proteins in Entrez, similar sequences with known 3D structure are detected by BLAST and alignments are recorded. The ‘Related Structure’ service summarizes this information and presents 3D views mapping sequence residues onto all 3D structures available in MMDB ().","biochemistry"

The assay is sensitive and robust, with Z values > 0.6, signal to background (S/B) > 16, and signal to noise (S/N) > 3. The assay was further validated with 2 different diversity sets of compounds against the SARS CoV. The “hit” rate for both libraries was approximately 0.01%. The validated HTS assay was then employed to screen a 100,000-compound library against SARS CoV. The hit rate for the library in a single-dose format was determined to be approximately 0.8%. Screening of the 3 libraries resulted in the identification of several novel compounds that effectively inhibited the CPE of SARS CoV in vitro—compounds which will serve as excellent lead candidates for further evaluation. At a 10-μM concentration, 3 compounds with selective indexes (SI50) of > 53 were discovered.","chemistry"
"The 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is a key target for structure-based drug design against this viral infection. The enzyme recognizes peptide substrates with a glutamine residue at the P1 site. A series of keto-glutamine analogues with a phthalhydrazido group at the α-position were synthesized and tested as reversible inhibitiors against SARS 3CLpro. Attachment of tripeptide (Ac-Val-Thr-Leu) to these glutamine-based “warheads” generated significantly better inhibitors (4a−c, 8a−d) with IC50 values ranging from 0.60 to 70 μM.","chemistry"
"In response to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) the Hong Kong Government promptly constructed 558 new state-of-the-art SARS isolation rooms with more than 1300 beds in 14 hospitals. These were completed by the end of 2003 and some will be available for H5N1 influenza patients, if any human cases occur. We investigated the ventilation of the wards after 18 months of operation and identified the major factors that affect ventilation effectiveness. Negative pressure, airflow path, air change rate and local ventilation effectiveness in selected rooms in 9 major hospitals were measured and their performance assessed against CDC requirements. Testing in 38 rooms found that 97% met the recommended negative pressure difference of 2.5 Pa between corridor and anteroom, 89% of 48 met the same requirement between anteroom and cubicle. No leakage of air to the corridor was found, but 60% of the toilets/bathrooms were operated under positive pressure. Over 90% of corridor-anteroom or anteroom-cubicle doors had bi-directional flow when the door was open. Of 35 tested cubicles, 26% had an air change rate <12 ACH and their ventilation was non-uniform. Despite using state-of-the-art technologies, 28% of the rooms tested still failed to meet the 12 ACH ventilation requirement and 60% had the wrong airflow direction for the toilets/bathrooms, but all satisfied the requirement of no air leakage to the corridor. Regular checks of airflow direction and air change rate are highly recommended together with specific education or training of hospital maintenance engineers and health care workers.","public"
"A rapid, sensitive, and accurate laboratory diagnostic test is needed for distinguishing Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) from other diseases featuring similar clinical symptoms and also for preventing potential outbreaks. In this study, a TaqMan reverse transcription (RT)‐polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for rapid detection and quantification of the viral RNA of various JEV strains. A consensus JEV NS3 region was chosen to design the primers and the TaqMan probe. The JEV TaqMan assay used the EZ‐rTtH RT‐PCR system featuring advantages such as a one‐step, high‐temperature RT reaction modality and preventing carry‐over contamination. The sensitivity of the JEV TaqMan assay for detecting in vitro‐transcribed JEV NS3 RNA was estimated to be one to five copies of RNA per reaction. For cultured JE virions, less than 40 plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml of virus load (corresponding to 0.07 PFU/test) could be detected. In addition, the JEV TaqMan assay could detect all seven strains of JEV tested, but provided negative results for nine other flaviviruses and encephalitis viruses tested. The JEV TaqMan assay demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than traditional RT‐PCR methods as has been previously reported. The application of the JEV TaqMan assay herein has been shown to the sensitive detection of the JEV from both mosquito pools and also JEV‐spiking human blood. The assay should be of use in diagnostic laboratory conduct and could be used to replace or complement time‐consuming viral‐culture methods, thus achieving more rapid, sensitive, and highly specific identification of JEV infection.

"Background. Definite diagnosis of Leishmania infections is based on demonstration of the parasite by microscopic analysis of tissue biopsy specimens or aspirate samples. However, microscopy generally shows low sensitivity and requires invasive sampling. Methods. We describe here the development of a simple and rapid test for the detection of polymerase chain reaction-amplified Leishmania DNA. A phase 1 evaluation of the text was conducted in clinical samples from 60 nonendemic and 45 endemic control subjects and from 44 patients with confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), 12 with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), and 43 with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) from Peru, Kenya, and Sudan. Results. The lower detection limits of the assay are 10 fg of Leishmania DNA and 1 parasite in 180 µL of blood. The specificity was 98.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.1%–99.7%) and 95.6% (95% CI, 85.2%–98.8%) for nonendemic and endemic control samples, respectively, and the sensitivity was 93.2% (95% CI, 81.8%–97.7%), 91.7% (95% CI, 64.6%–98.5%), and 86% (95% CI, 72.7%–93.4%) for lesions from patients with CL or MCL and blood from patients with VL, respectively. Conclusions. The Leishmania OligoC-TesT showed high specificity and sensitivity in clinical samples and was able to detect the parasite in samples obtained by less invasive means, such as blood, lymph, and lesion scrapings. The assay is a promising new tool for simplified and standardized molecular detection of Leishmania parasites.","microbiology"
"Faecal samples were taken from cats living in multi-cat households with endemic feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Total RNA was extracted from faecal suspensions and FCoV RNA was quantified using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle (CT) values were consistently high suggesting that the samples contained very little viral RNA. However, experiments in which RNA extracted from FCoV-infected cell culture supernatants was combined with RNA extracted from faecal suspensions revealed the presence of faecal factors that significantly inhibited the reverse transcription reaction. Consequently, three methods of RNA extraction were investigated and RNA dilution was undertaken to investigate whether the effects of the faecal inhibitors could be reduced. Our results show that using the QIAgen RNA mini kit for RNA extraction and dilution of the RNA samples helps to reduce the inhibitory effects. However, because the extent of the inhibitory effects varied between faecal samples, accurate quantification proved difficult. We, therefore, conclude that although real-time RT-PCR provides an excellent method for detecting the presence of viral shedding, quantification of FCoV RNA in faecal material has to take into account the possible effects of RT-PCR inhibitors. It is, therefore, essential that all new assays, and the methods of sample preparation, are carefully evaluated before being used in a clinical setting.","veterinary"
"Coronaviruses strains 229E and OC43 have been associated with various respiratory illnesses ranging from the self-resolving common cold to severe pneumonia. Although chronic underlying conditions are major determinants of severe respiratory virus infections, few data about coronavirus-related pneumonia in immunocompromised patients are available. Here we report 2 well-documented cases of pneumonia related to coronavirus 229E, each with a different clinical presentation. Diagnosis was made on the basis of viral culture and electron microscopy findings that exhibited typical crown-like particles and through amplification of the viral genome by reverse transcriptase—polymerase chain reaction. On the basis of this report, coronaviruses should be considered as potential causative microorganisms of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.","microbiology"

"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition is a recent, clinically validated therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) block angiogenesis, arrest cell growth, and lead to differentiation and apoptosis in tumor cells. In this article, a survey of published quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) studies are presented and discussed in the hope of identifying the structural determinants for anticancer activity. Secondly a two‐dimensional QSAR study was carried out on biological results derived from various types of HDACIs and from different assays using the C‐QSAR program of Biobyte. The QSAR analysis presented here is an attempt to organize the knowledge on the HDACIs with the purpose of designing new chemical entities with enhanced inhibitory potencies and to study the mechanism of action of the compounds. This study revealed that lipophilicity is one of the most important determinants of activity. Additionally, steric factors such as the overall molar refractivity (CMR), molar volume (MgVol), the substituent's molar refractivity (MR) (linear or parabola), or the sterimol parameters B1 and L are important.

"Adenosine is an ubiquitous local modulator that regulates various physiological and pathological functions by stimulating four membrane receptors, namely A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. Among these G protein‐coupled receptors, the A3 subtype is found mainly in the lung, liver, heart, eyes, and brain in our body. It has been associated with cerebroprotection and cardioprotection, as well as modulation of cellular growth upon its selective activation. On the other hand, its inhibition by selective antagonists has been reported to be potentially useful in the treatment of pathological conditions including glaucoma, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. In this review, we focused on the pharmacology and the therapeutic implications of the human (h)A3 adenosine receptor (AR), together with an overview on the progress of hA3AR agonists, antagonists, allosteric modulators, and radioligands, as well as on the recent advances pertaining to the computational approaches (e.g., quantitative structure–activity relationships, homology modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations) applied to the modeling of hA3AR and drug design.  © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) has been identified as a potential threat to the safety of blood products. The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System uses riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light to render blood‐borne pathogens noninfectious while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against MERS‐CoV when tested in human plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MERS‐CoV (EMC strain) was used to inoculate plasma units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light. The infectious titers of MERS‐CoV in the samples before and after treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. The treatments were initially performed in triplicate using pooled plasma (n = 3) and then repeated using individual plasma units (n = 6). RESULTS: In both studies, riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of MERS‐CoV below the limit of detection. The mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥4.07 and ≥4.42 for the pooled and individual donor plasma, respectively. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of MERS‐CoV in human plasma products to below the limit of detection, suggesting that the treatment process may reduce the risk of transfusion transmission of MERS‐CoV.","hematology"
"Interferons (IFNs) have been used to treat mucosal lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, such as intraepithelial precursor lesions to cancer of the uterine cervix, genital warts or recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, to potentially reduce or eliminate replicating HPV plasmid genomes. Mucosal HPVs have evolved mechanisms that impede IFN-β synthesis and downregulate genes induced by IFN. Here we show that these HPV types directly subvert a cellular transcriptional response to IFN-β as a potential boost in infection. Treatment with low levels of human IFN-β induced initial amplification of HPV-16 and HPV-11 plasmid genomes and increased HPV-16 or HPV-31 DNA copy numbers up to 6-fold in HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. IFN treatment also increased early gene transcription from the major early gene promoters in HPV-16, HPV-31 and HPV-11. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the viral genomes and ectopic interferon regulatory factor (IRF) expression in transfection experiments using IRF-1−/−, IRF-2−/− and dual knockout cell lines determined that these responses are due to the activation of IRF-1 interaction with a conserved interferon response element demonstrated in several mucosal HPV early gene promoters. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the varying clinical outcomes of IFN therapy of papillomatoses and define an assay for the modulation of the HPV gene program by IFNs as well as other cytokines and signaling molecules in infection and therapy.","oncology"
"The ribosomal frameshifting signal of the mouse embryonal carcinoma differentiation regulated (Edr) gene represents the sole documented example of programmed −1 frameshifting in mammalian cellular genes [Shigemoto,K., Brennan,J., Walls,E,. Watson,C.J., Stott,D., Rigby,P.W. and Reith,A.D. (2001), Nucleic Acids Res., 29, 4079–4088]. Here, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis and RNA structure probing to characterize the Edr signal. We began by confirming the functionality and magnitude of the signal and the role of a GGGAAAC motif as the slippery sequence. Subsequently, we derived a model of the Edr stimulatory RNA and assessed its similarity to those stimulatory RNAs found at viral frameshift sites. We found that the structure is an RNA pseudoknot possessing features typical of retroviral frameshifter pseudoknots. From these experiments, we conclude that the Edr signal and by inference, the human orthologue PEG10, do not represent a novel ‘cellular class’ of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signal, but rather are similar to viral examples, albeit with some interesting features. The similarity to viral frameshift signals may complicate the design of antiviral therapies that target the frameshift process.","biochemistry"
"Although efficient methods exist to assemble synthetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes, these suffer from the presence of 1–3 random errors/kb of DNA. Here, we introduce a new method termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic DNA. In this method, errors are revealed as mismatches by re-hybridization of the population. The DNA is fragmented, and mismatched fragments are removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch binding protein (MutS). PCR assembly of the remaining fragments yields a new population of full-length sequences enriched for the consensus sequence of the input population. We show that two iterations of consensus shuffling improved a population of synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) clones from ∼60 to >90% fluorescent, and decreased errors 3.5- to 4.3-fold to final values of ∼1 error per 3500 bp. In addition, two iterations of consensus shuffling corrected a population of GFPuv clones where all members were non-functional, to a population where 82% of clones were fluorescent. Consensus shuffling should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of long DNA sequences.","biochemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global challenge affecting more than 8000 patients in different continents. The dictum of public health practice especially for infectious disease is “prevention better than cure”. It is especially true for SARS as the treatment strategies remain diverse and experimental. Maintaining a healthy and hygienic environment can be one of the effective public health measures to combat infectious disease. The major challenge is that some of the most important public health measures are to be taken outside the health sector. The community also needs to be strengthened and equipped with the health skills to promote better health and hygiene. There is also the need to create a supportive environment conducive to health for long term sustainability. The WHO approach of promoting health through setting approach would be one possible solution to face the challenge. This paper will describe some of the public health initiatives in Hong Kong through “setting approach” and “community development model” in helping the society fight against SARS. With the emergence of SARS, this might be the time to globalise public health medicine as an important component of medical practice.","public"
"Background: The clinical response of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin was examined after establishing the in vitro antiviral susceptibility of the SARS associated coronavirus to a panel of antiviral agents. Methods: The in vitro susceptibility of the prototype of SARS associated coronavirus to a panel of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors currently licensed for clinical use was studied. Forty one patients with SARS followed for 3 weeks were treated with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. The clinical progress and virological outcomes were monitored and compared with 111 patients treated with ribavirin only who served as historical controls. Results: In vitro antiviral activity against SARS associated coronavirus was demonstrated for lopinavir and ribavirin at concentrations of 4 µg/ml and 50 µg/ml, respectively, only at 48 hours. The adverse clinical outcome (ARDS or death) was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the historical controls (2.4% v 28.8%, p<0.001) at day 21 after the onset of symptoms. The adverse outcome remained significantly lower in the treatment group than in the controls—both those diagnosed early (p<0.001) and those diagnosed later in the course of the epidemic (p = 0.002)—but there was no significant difference in adverse outcome rates between the two time periods (p = 0.548). No time related difference in outcome was observed in the control groups. A reduction in steroid usage and nosocomial infections was seen in patients initially treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, and these patients had a decreasing viral load and rising peripheral lymphocyte count. Multivariate analysis showed that age, hepatitis B carrier status, and lack of treatment with this antiviral combination were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. Lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was associated with a better outcome even when adjusted for baseline lactate dehydrogenase level. Conclusions: The apparent favourable clinical response with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin supports further randomised placebo controlled trials in patients with SARS.","respiratory"

"Programmed frameshifting is one of the translational recoding mechanisms that read the genetic code in alternative ways. This process is generally programmed by signals at defined locations in a specific mRNA. In this study, we report the identification of hepta- and octo-uridine stretches as sole signals for programmed +1 and −1 ribosomal frameshifting during translation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF 3a variants. SARS-CoV ORF 3a encodes a minor structural protein of 274 amino acids. Over the course of cloning and expression of the gene, a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. In vitro and in vivo expression of clones with six, seven and eight Ts, respectively, showed the detection of the full-length 3a protein. Mutagenesis studies led to the identification of the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches as slippery sequences for efficient frameshifting. Interestingly, no stimulatory elements were found in the sequences upstream or downstream of the slippage site. When the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches were used to replace the original slippery sequence of the SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b, efficient frameshift events were observed. Furthermore, the efficiencies of frameshifting mediated by the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches were not affected by mutations introduced into a downstream stem–loop structure that totally abolish the frameshift event mediated by the original slippery sequence of ORF 1a and 1b. Taken together, this study identifies the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches that function as sole elements for efficient +1 and −1 ribosomal frameshift events.","biochemistry"
"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease. No information is currently available on host-specific immunity against the SARS coronavirus (CoV), and detailed characteristics of the epidemiology of SARS CoV infection have not been identified. Methods. ELISA was used to detect antibody to SARS CoV. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to detect SARS CoV RNA. T cells in peripheral blood of patients were quantified by flow cytometry. Results. Of 36 patients with probable SARS CoV infection, 30 (83.3%) were positive for IgG antibody to SARS CoV; in contrast, only 3 of 48 patients with suspected SARS CoV infection, 0 of 112 patients with fever but without SARS, and 0 of 96 healthy control individuals were positive for it. IgG antibody to SARS CoV was first detected between day 5 and day 47 after onset of illness (mean ± SD, 18.7±10.4). Conclusion. Detection of antibody to SARS CoV is useful in the diagnosis of SARS; however, at the incubation and initial phases of the illness, serological assay is of little value, because of late seroconversion in most patients.","microbiology"

"The host cellular environment is a key determinant of pathogen infectivity. Viral gene expression and viral particle production of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)–deficient and G6PD-knockdown cells were much higher than their counterparts when human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E was applied at 0.1 multiplicity of infection. These phenomena were correlated with increased oxidant production. Accordingly, ectopic expression of G6PD in G6PD-deficient cells or addition of antioxidant (such as α-lipoic acid) to G6PD-knockdown cells attenuated the increased susceptibility to HCoV 229E infection. All experimental data indicated that oxidative stress in host cells is an important factor in HCoV 229E infectivity","microbiology"
"Background. The clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia, making diagnosis difficult. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities, particularly lymphopenia, are common in patients with SARS. Methods. With the use of 2 databases, we compared the ability of the absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, lactate dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and serum calcium level at hospital admission to discriminate between cases of SARS and cases of community-acquired pneumonia. The SARS database contained data for 144 patients with SARS from the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak. The community-acquired pneumonia database contained data for 8044 patients with community-acquired pneumonia from Edmonton, Canada. Patients from the SARS database were matched to patients from the community-acquired pneumonia database according to age, and receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each laboratory variable. Results. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) demonstrated fair to poor discriminatory ability for all laboratory variables tested except absolute neutrophil count, which had an AUC of 0.80, indicating good discriminatory ability (although there was no cutoff value of the absolute neutrophil count at which reasonable sensitivity or specificity could be obtained). Combinations of any 2 tests did not perform significantly better than did the absolute neutrophil count alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory tests, including determination of absolute lymphocyte count, should not be used in the diagnosis of SARS or incorporated into current case definitions of SARS. The role of the absolute neutrophil count in SARS diagnosis is likely limited, but it should be assessed further.","microbiology"
"Objectives: To describe the immunological responses and clinical outcome of coronavirus (SARS) infected healthcare workers (HCW) who had been administered with convalescent plasma as a treatment. Methods: Convalescent plasma (500 mL) was obtained from each of three SARS patients and transfused into the three infected HCW. Donors were blood type O and seronegative for hepatitis B and C, HIV, syphilis and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II). Serum antibody (IgG) titre was >640. Apharesis was performed with a CS 3000 plus cell separator followed by the forming of the convalescent phase plasma. As part of the routine check with donated plasma, the convalescent plasma was confirmed free of residual SARS-CoV by RT–PCR. Serial serum samples obtained from the recipients of the convalescent plasma were collected to undertake real-time quantitative RT–PCR for SARS-CoV for direct measurement of viral concentration. Specific immunoglobulin IgM and IgG concentrations were titrated using an antigen microarray developed in-house. Results: Viral load dropped from 495 × 103, 76 × 103 or 650 × 103 copies/mL to zero or 1 copy/mL one day after transfusion. Anti-SARS-CoV IgM and IgG also increased in a time-dependent manner following transfusion. All three patients survived. One HCW became pregnant subsequently, delivering 13 months after discharge. Positive anti-SARS-CoV IgG was detected in the newborn. Passive transfer of anti-SARS-CoV antibody from the mother was considered as a possibility. Conclusions: All infected HCW whose condition had progressed severely and who had failed to respond to the available treatment, survived after transfusion with convalescent plasma.","pharmacology"
"The next influenza pandemic may be imminent. Because antiviral agents and vaccines will be unavailable to people in most countries, we need to determine whether other agents could offer clinical benefits. Influenza is associated with an increase in acute cardiovascular diseases, and influenza viruses induce proinflammatory cytokines. Statins are cardioprotective and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and they thus might benefit patients with influenza. This hypothesis should be evaluated by using administrative databases to search for reduced rates of hospitalization and death due to influenza-related conditions among people taking statins. These studies should be followed by laboratory studies of statins in animal and cell-based models of influenza virus infection and, later, by clinical trials. Positive results from such studies would provide physicians in all countries with something to offer patients for treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza. Generic statins will be widely distributed and inexpensive. They might be the only agents that could alter the course of a global pandemic.","microbiology"
"Spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus (S protein) plays a pivotal role in SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) infection. The immunological fragment of the S protein (Ala251−His641, SARS_S1b) is believed to be essential for SARS_CoV entering the host cell through S protein−ACE-2 interaction. We have quantitatively characterized the thermally induced and GuHCl-induced unfolding features of SARS_S1b using circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence, and stopped-flow spectral techniques. For the thermally induced unfolding at pH 7.4, the apparent activation energy (Eapp) and transition midpoint temperature (Tm) were determined to be 16.3 ± 0.2 kcal/mol and 52.5 ± 0.4 °C, respectively. The CD spectra are not dependent on temperature, suggesting that the secondary structure of SARS_S1b has a relatively high thermal stability. GuHCl strongly affected SARS_S1b structure. Both the CD and fluorescent spectra resulted in consistent values of the transition middle concentration of the denaturant (Cm, ranging from 2.30 to 2.45 M) and the standard free energy change (ΔG°, ranging from 2.1 to 2.5 kcal/mol) for the SARS_S1b unfolding reaction. Moreover, the kinetic features of the chemical unfolding and refolding of SARS_S1b were also characterized using a stopped-flow CD spectral technique. The obvious unfolding reaction rates and relaxation times were determined at various GuHCl concentrations, and the Cm value was obtained, which is very close to the data that resulted from CD and fluorescent spectral determinations. Secondary and three-dimensional structural predictions by homology modeling indicated that SARS_S1b folded as a globular-like structure by β-sheets and loops; two of the four tryptophans are located on the protein surface, which is in agreement with the tryptophan fluorescence result. The three-dimensional model was also used to explain the recently published experimental results of S1−ACE-2 binding and immunizations.","biochemistry"
"BackgroundA novel human rhinovirus (HRV) species, HRV-C, was recently discovered, but its clinical features and epidemiology, compared with HRV-A and HRV-B, remains poorly understood, especially in adults MethodsOne thousand two hundred nasopharyngeal aspirate samples obtained from hospitalized children and adults during a 1-year period were subject to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect HRV. The clinical and molecular epidemiology of the 3 HRV species was analyzed ResultsHRVs were detected in 178 (29.7%) of 600 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from children and 42 (7%) of 600 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from adults. HRV-A was most prevalent (n=111), followed by HRV-C (n=91) and HRV-B (n=18). Although upper respiratory tract infection was the most common presentation in children, 8 (62%) of the 13 adults with HRV-C infection had pneumonia, compared with 6 (27%) of the 22 adults with HRV-A infection (P<.05). Wheezing episodes were also more common among individuals with HRV-C (37%) and HRV-A (20%) infection than among those with HRV-B (0%) infection (P<.05).

"Host–pathogen interactions involve protein expression changes within both the host and the pathogen. An understanding of the nature of these interactions provides insight into metabolic processes and critical regulatory events of the host cell as well as into the mechanisms of pathogenesis by infectious microorganisms. Pathogen exposure induces changes in host proteins at many functional levels including cell signaling pathways, protein degradation, cytokines and growth factor production, phagocytosis, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Since proteins are responsible for the cell biological functions, pathogens have evolved to manipulate the host cell proteome to achieve optimal replication. Intracellular pathogens can also change their proteome to adapt to the host cell and escape from immune surveillance, or can incorporate cellular proteins to invade other cells. Given that the interactions of intracellular infectious agents with host cells are mainly at the protein level, proteomics is the most suitable tool for investigating these interactions. Proteomics is the systematic analysis of proteins, particularly their interactions, modifications, localization and functions, that permits the study of the association between pathogens with their host cells as well as complex interactions such as the host–vector–pathogen interplay. A review on the most relevant proteomic applications used in the study of host–pathogen interactions is presented.","biochemistry"
"Background. We report the temporal-spatial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among inpatients in a hospital ward during a major nosocomial outbreak and discuss possible mechanisms for the outbreak. Methods. All inpatients who had stayed in the same ward as the initial index case patient for any duration before isolation were recruited into a cohort and followed up to document the occurrence of SARS. The normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols at different locations of the ward was estimated by use of computational fluid dynamics modeling. The attack rates in the various subgroups stratified by bed location were calculated. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to document important risk factors. Results. The overall attack rate of SARS was 41% (30 of 74 subjects). It was 65%, 52%, and 18% in the same bay, adjacent bay, and distant bays, respectively (P = .001). Computation fluid dynamics modeling indicated that the normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols was highest in the same bay and lowest in the distant bays. Cox regression indicated that staying in the ward on 6 or 10 March entailed higher risk, as well as staying in the same or adjacent bays. The epidemic curve showed 2 peaks, and stratified analyses by bed location suggested >1 generation of spread. Conclusions. The temporal-spatial spread of SARS in the ward was consistent with airborne transmission, as modeled by use of computational fluid dynamics.

As demonstrated by the response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza, genomic sequencing has become an important method for diagnosing agents of infectious disease. Despite the value of genomic sequences in characterizing novel pathogens, raw data on their own do not provide the information needed by public health officials and researchers. One must integrate knowledge of the genomes of pathogens with host biology and geography to understand the etiology of epidemics. To these ends, we have created an application called Supramap (http://supramap.osu.edu) to put information on the spread of pathogens and key mutations across time, space and various hosts into a geographic information system (GIS). To build this application, we created a web service for integrated sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis as well as methods to describe the tree, mutations, and host shifts in Keyhole Markup Language (KML). We apply the application to 239 sequences of the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene of recent isolates of avian influenza (H5N1). We map a mutation, glutamic acid to lysine at position 627 in the PB2 protein (E627K), in H5N1 influenza that allows for increased replication of the virus in mammals. We use a statistical test to support the hypothesis of a correlation of E627K mutations with avian‐mammalian host shifts but reject the hypothesis that lineages with E627K are moving westward.

"The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly described member of the Paramyxoviridae family belonging to the Metapneumovirus genus. Since its initial description in 2001, hMPV has been reported in most parts of the world and isolated from the respiratory tract of subjects from all age groups. Despite the fact that prospective and case-control studies have been limited, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations associated with hMPV have been found to be reminiscent of those of the human respiratory syncytial virus, with most severe respiratory tract infections occurring in infants, elderly subjects, and immunocompromised hosts. Additional research is needed to define the pathogenesis of this viral infection and the host's specific immune response.","microbiology"
"We have identified the membrane-active regions of the full sequences of the HCV E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins by performing an exhaustive study of membrane leakage, hemifusion, and fusion induced by 18-mer peptide libraries on model membranes having different phospholipid compositions. The data and their comparison have led us to identify different E1 and E2 membrane-active segments which might be implicated in viral membrane fusion, membrane interaction, and/or protein−protein binding. Moreover, it has permitted us to suggest that the fusion peptide might be located in the E1 glycoprotein and, more specifically, the segment comprised by amino acid residues 265−296. The identification of these membrane-active segments from the E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins, as well as their membranotropic propensity, supports their direct role in HCV-mediated membrane fusion, sustains the notion that different segments provide the driving force for the merging of the viral and target cell membranes, and defines those segments as attractive targets for further development of new antiviral compounds.","biochemistry"

Tools for the exploration and analysis of signatures allow (i) identification of the origin of DNA segments (detection of rare species or species for which technical problems prevent fast characterization, such as micro-organisms with slow growth), (ii) analysis of the homogeneity of a genome and isolation of areas with novel functionality (horizontal transfers for example) – and (iii) molecular phylogeny and taxonomy.","biochemistry"
"We have previously identified neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) by panning a large nonimmune antibody library against a soluble form of the HeV attachment-envelope glycoprotein G (sGHeV). One of these antibodies, m102, which exhibited the highest level of cross-reactive neutralization of both NiV and HeV G, was affinity maturated by light-chain shuffling combined with random mutagenesis of its heavy-chain variable domain and panning against sGHeV. One of the selected antibody Fab clones, m102.4, had affinity of binding to sGHeV that was equal to or higher than that of the other Fabs; it was converted to IgG1 and tested against infectious NiV and HeV. It exhibited exceptionally potent and cross-reactive inhibitory activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations below 0.04 and 0.6 μg/mL, respectively. The virus-neutralizing activity correlated with the binding affinity of the antibody to sGHeV and sGNiV. m102.4 bound a soluble form of NiV G (sGNiV) better than it bound sGHeV, and it neutralized NiV better than HeV, despite being originally selected against sGHeV. These results suggest that m102.4 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of diseases caused by henipaviruses. It could be also used for prophylaxis and diagnosis, and as a research reagent","microbiology"
"Aims: To develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) detection and explore the potential of using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control to exclude false negative results. Methods: SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both measured in 26 specimens from 16 patients with SARS, 40 follow up specimens from the same batch of patients, and appropriate control subjects. The relation between SARS positivity and GAPDH mRNA concentration was investigated using the χ2 test. Increasing the sensitivity for SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA detection was investigated in follow up specimens in which SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were not detected initially. Results: Varying amounts of SARS-CoV were found in the 26 SARS-CoV positive specimens and SARS-CoV was not detected in the 40 follow up specimens and controls. In addition, concentrations of GAPDH mRNA were significantly different between the patients with SARS, follow up specimens, and healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.05). Moreover, GAPDH mRNA concentrations were highly correlated with SARS-CoV positivity (χ2 = 5.43; p<0.05). Finally, SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both detected in three follow up urine specimens that were initially negative when the amount of cDNA used was increased from 5 μl to 10 and 15 μl. Conclusions: This Q-RT-PCR assay can be used to detect SARS-CoV. Moreover, GAPDH mRNA may be useful to rule out false negative results in SARS-CoV detection, and the current extraction method for urine may not be sensitive enough to detect low titres of SARS-CoV.","pathology"
"The extensive data collection and contact tracing that occurred during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong, China, allowed the authors to examine how the probability of transmission varied from the date of symptom onset to the date of hospitalization for household contacts of SARS patients. Using a discrete-time likelihood model, the authors estimated the transmission probability per contact for each day following the onset of symptoms. The results suggested that there may be two peaks in the probability of SARS transmission, the first occurring around day 2 after symptom onset and the second occurring approximately 10 days after symptom onset. Index patients who were aged 60 years or older or whose lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated upon admission to the hospital (indicating higher viral loads) were more likely to transmit SARS to their contacts. There was little variation in the daily transmission probabilities before versus after the introduction of public health interventions on or around March 26, 2003. This study suggests that the probability of transmission of SARS is dependent upon characteristics of the index patients and does not simply reflect temporal variability in the viral load of SARS cases.","public"
"Effective surveillance is necessary for the successful management of emerging infection. It allows public health protection measures such as contact tracing and isolation to be put in place. This study aimed to find the most appropriate surveillance method for a disease like SARS. Existing surveillance methods were evaluated against a set of new criteria in a qualitative manner. Influenza and tuberculosis (TB) surveillance were used as models. A literature search was undertaken to find relevant evidence. The results show that TB surveillance is more appropriate than influenza surveillance as a model because it is more complete in its reporting. Clinician‐based reporting is better than laboratory‐based because it is more timely. The results suggest a clinician‐based notification system would be the most appropriate form of surveillance for a disease like SARS for public health purposes.","public"
"Glycans (sugars or carbohydrates) are predominant surface components of cells such as erythrocytes, immune cells and microorganisms. As such, they give rise to high levels of anti-glycan antibodies of all classes. Antibodies to certain defined mono, di and oligosaccharides that are common in bacterial, fungal and parasite cells exist in human sera and can be profiled using glycan arrays. The use of glycan arrays for systematic screening of blood samples from multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn’s disease (CD) patients in versus to blood samples from control groups, have lead to the discovery of a few anti glycan antibodies biomarkers enabling diagnosis and prognosis in MS and CD patients. Anti-Glc(α1,4)Glc(α) IgM antibodies were found to be specific for MS patients, enabling differentiation between MS patients and patients with other neurological diseases, with 54% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Anti-Glc(α1,4)Glc(α) IgM were found to be predictive for the conversion of patients in first acute neurological event to clinically defined MS. Anti-laminaribioside (ALCA), anti-mannobioside (AMCA) and anti-chitobioside (ACCA) antibodies were found to be specific for CD. The combined use of these antibodies enables improved diagnosis of CD versus ulcerative colitis and other gastrointestinal diseases, as well as stratification of CD patients with a more complicated disease and high risk for surgery. Anti-glycan antibodies profiling (AGAP) is a new and promising approach for development of biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.","rheumatology"
"Rodents are recognized reservoir hosts for many human zoonotic pathogens. The current trends resulting from anthropocene defaunation suggest that in the future they, along with other small mammals, are likely to become the dominant mammals in almost all human‐modified environments. Recent intricate studies on bat‐borne emerging diseases have highlighted that many gaps exist in our understanding of the zoonotic transmission of rodent‐borne pathogens. This has emphasized the need for scientists interested in rodent‐borne diseases to integrate rodent ecology into their analysis of rodent‐borne pathogen transmission in order to identify in more detail the mechanisms of spillover and chains of transmission. Further studies are required to better understand the true impact of rodent abundance and the importance of pathogen sharing and circulation in multi‐host– multi‐pathogen communities. We also need to explore in more depth the roles of generalist and abundant species as the potential links between pathogen‐sharing, co‐infections and disease transmission.","zoology"
"The biogenesis events and formation of dengue virus (DENV) in the infected host cells remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined the ultrastructural changes associated with DENV-2 replication in three susceptible host cells, C6/36, Vero and SK Hep1, a cell line of human endothelial origin, using transmission electron microscopy, whole-mount grid-cell culture techniques and electron tomography (ET). The prominent feature in C6/36 cells was the formation of large perinuclear vacuoles with mature DENV particles, and on-grid whole-mount examination of the infected Vero cells showed different forms of DENV core structures associated with cellular membranes within 48 h after infection. Distinct multivesicular structures and prominent autophagic vesicles were seen in the infected SK Hep1 cells when compared with the other two cell lines. ET showed the three-dimensional organization of these vesicles as a continuous system. This is the first report of ET-based analysis of DENV-2 replication in a human endothelial cell line. These results further emphasizes the strong role played by intracellular host membranes–virus interactions in the biogenesis of DENV and strongly argues for the possibility of targeting compounds to block such structure formation as key anti-dengue agents.","microscopy"
"Background. Between 50% and 80% of asthma exacerbations are associated with viral respiratory tract infections (RTIs), yet the influence of viral pathogen diversity on asthma outcomes is poorly understood because of the limited scope and throughput of conventional viral detection methods. Methods. We investigated the capability of the Virochip, a DNA microarray—based viral detection platform, to characterize viral diversity in RTIs in adults with and without asthma. Results. The Virochip detected viruses in a higher proportion of samples (65%) than did culture isolation (17%) while exhibiting high concordance (98%) with and comparable sensitivity (97%) and specificity (98%) to pathogen-specific polymerase chain reaction. A similar spectrum of viruses was identified in the RTIs of each patient subgroup; however, unexpected diversity among human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and human rhinoviruses (HRVs) was revealed. All but one of the HCoVs corresponded to the newly recognized HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses, and >20 different serotypes of HRVs were detected, including a set of 5 divergent isolates that formed a distinct genetic subgroup. Conclusions. The Virochip can detect both known and novel variants of viral pathogens present in RTIs. Given the diversity detected here, larger-scale studies will be necessary to determine whether particular substrains of viruses confer an elevated risk of asthma exacerbation.","microbiology"
"Background. Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with respiratory tract infections in children. We conducted the first systematic prospective clinical and molecular study using nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and fecal samples. Methods. NPAs negative for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus and fecal samples from patients with acute gastroenteritis were included. On the basis of results from a pilot study using 400 NPAs from all age groups, a prospective 12-month study was conducted to detect HBoV in 1200 NPAs and 1435 fecal samples from patients <18 years old by polymerase chain reaction. The complete genome sequences of HBoVs from 12 NPAs and 12 fecal samples were determined. Results. Of the 400 NPAs collected in the pilot study, 20 (5.0%) were found to contain HBoV, all from children <5 years old. In the subsequent prospective study of pediatric patients, HBoV was detected in 83 (6.9%) of 1200 NPAs. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were equally common. HBoV was detected in 30 (2.1%) of 1435 fecal samples. Fever and watery diarrhea were the most common symptoms. The seasonality of HBoV in NPAs and fecal samples was similar. Codetection with other pathogens occurred in 33% and 56% of NPAs and fecal samples, respectively, from patients with HBoV infection. Genomes of HBoVs from NPAs and fecal samples displayed minimal sequence variations. Conclusions. HBoV was detected in fecal specimens in children with acute gastroenteritis. A single lineage of HBoV was associated with both respiratory tract and enteric infections.","microbiology"
"Background. We sought to determine whether infections with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 are associated with pneumonia and to define the epidemiology of HCoV infection in rural Thailand. Methods. We developed a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay panel for the recognized HCoV types and compared HCoV infections in patients hospitalized with pneumonia, outpatients with influenza-like illness, and asymptomatic control patients between September 2003 and August 2005. Results. During study year 1, 43 (5.9%) of 734 patients with pneumonia had HCoV infections; 72.1% of the infections were with OC43. During study year 2, when control patients were available, 21 (1.8%) of 1156 patients with pneumonia, 12 (2.3%) of 513 outpatients, and 6 (2.1%) of 281 control patients had HCoV infections. Compared with infection in control patients, infection with any HCoV type or with all types combined was not associated with pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio for all HCoV types, 0.67 [95% confidence interval, 0.26–1.75]; P= .40 ). HCoV infections were detected throughout both study years; 93.6% of OC43 infections in the first year occurred from January through March. Conclusions. HCoV infections were infrequently detected in rural Thailand by use of sensitive real-time RTPCR assays. We found no association between HCoV infection and illness. However, we noted year-to-year variation in the prevalence of HCoV strains, which likely influenced our results.","microbiology"
"A method for the isolation of genomic fragments of RNA virus based on cDNA representational difference analysis (cDNA RDA) was developed. cDNA RDA has been applied for the subtraction of poly(A)+ RNAs but not for poly(A)− RNAs, such as RNA virus genomes, owing to the vast quantity of ribosomal RNAs. We constructed primers for inefficient reverse transcription of ribosomal sequences based on the distribution analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA. The analysis revealed that distributions of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA and virus genome were different. We constructed 96 hexanucleotides (non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) and used them as mixed primers for reverse transcription of cDNA RDA. A synchronous analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in known viral sequences showed that all the known genomic-size viral sequences include non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. In a model experiment, when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used as primers, in vitro transcribed plasmid RNA was efficiently reverse transcribed when compared with ribosomal RNA of rat cells. Using non-ribosomal primers, the cDNA fragments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were efficiently amplified by subtracting the cDNA amplicons derived from uninfected cells from those that were derived from virus-infected cells. The results suggest that cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal primers can be used for species-independent detection of viruses, including new viruses.","biochemistry"
"The HIV-1 gp41 envelope glycoprotein is responsible for the membrane fusion between the virus and the target cell. According to recent models, the N-terminal coiled-coil (NHR) region of gp41 is involved in forming the interfaces between neighboring helices in the six-helix bundle, as well as in membrane binding and perturbation. In order to get new insights into the viral membrane fusion mechanism, two peptides, pFP15 and pFP23, pertaining to the first part of the gp41 NHR domain were studied regarding their structure and their ability to induce membrane leakage, aggregation, and fusion, as well as their affinity toward specific phospholipids by a variety of spectroscopic methods. Our results demonstrate that the first part of the NHR domain interacts with negatively charged phospholipid-containing model membranes, modifies the phase behavior of membrane phospholipids, and induces leakage and aggregation of liposomes, suggesting that it could be involved directly in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes working synergistically with other membrane-active regions of the gp41 glycoprotein to boost the fusion process. On the other hand, we suggest that this region of the NHR domain could be involved in the first steps of the destabilization of the HIV-1 gp41 six-helix bundle after its interaction with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups.","biochemistry"

Most often, this comprises the detection of viral antigens and antibodies, and less commonly the isolation of viruses and the detection of viral nucleic acids. However, there are no standards or guidelines available for processing these specimens in routine diagnostic laboratories or for referral to specialist virology centres or units. Clinical Pathology Accreditation (CPA) has defined standards for assessing the quality of service provided by laboratories, but these do not include the scientific and technical aspects of provision of service.

"Background. A high initial or peak severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)—associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) load in nasopharyngeal specimens was shown to be associated with a high mortality rate. Because all infected individuals were devoid of preeexisting protective immunity against SARS-CoV, the biological basis for the variable virus burdens in different patients remains elusive. Methods. The nationwide SARS database in Taiwan was analyzed, and genotyping of 281 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 65 genes was performed for 94 patients with SARS, to identify SNPs for which distribution between patients with or without detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was biased. Results. Titers of SARS-CoV shed in nasopharyngeal specimens varied widely, ranging from nondetectable to 108 SARS-CoV RNA copies/mL, and they were correlated positively with a high mortality rate (P < .0001, by trend test) and with early death (i.e., death occurring within 2 weeks of the onset of illness) (P = .0015, by trend test). Virus shedding was found to be higher among male patients (P = .0014, by multivariate logistic regression) and among older patients (P = .015, by multivariate logistic regression). Detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was associated with polymorphic alleles of interleukins 18 (P = .014) and 1A (P = .031) and a member of NFκB complex (reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B [RelB]) (P = .034), all of which are proinflammatory in nature, as well as the procoagulation molecule fibrinogen-like protein 2 (P = .008). Conclusion. The SARS-CoV load is a determinant of clinical outcomes of SARS, and it is associated with polymorphisms of genes involved in innate immunity, which might be regulated in an age- and sex-dependent manner. The findings of the present study provided leads to genes involved in the host response to SARS-CoV infection; if substantiated with functional studies, these findings may be applicable to other newly emerged respiratory viruses (e.g., the influenza pandemic strain).","microbiology"

"Ubiquitin‐specific proteases (USPs) emerge as key regulators of numerous cellular processes and account for the bulk of human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Their modular structure, mostly annotated by sequence homology, is believed to determine substrate recognition and subcellular localization. Currently, a large proportion of known human USP sequences are not annotated either structurally or functionally, including regions both within and flanking their catalytic cores. To extend the current understanding of human USPs, we applied consensus fold recognition to the unannotated content of the human USP family. The most interesting discovery was the marked presence of reliably predicted ubiquitin‐like (UBL) domains in this family of enzymes. The UBL domain thus appears to be the most frequently occurring domain in the human USP family, after the characteristic catalytic domain. The presence of multiple UBL domains per USP protein, as well as of UBL domains embedded in the USP catalytic core, add to the structural complexity currently recognized for many DUBs. Possible functional roles of the newly uncovered UBL domains of human USPs, including proteasome binding, and substrate and protein target specificities, are discussed.

"Coronaviruses comprise a large group of RNA viruses with diverse host specificity. The emergence of highly pathogenic strains like the SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), and the discovery of two new coronaviruses, NL‐63 and HKU1, corroborates the high rate of mutation and recombination that have enabled them to cross species barriers and infect novel hosts. For that reason, the development of broad‐spectrum antivirals that are effective against several members of this family is highly desirable. This goal can be accomplished by designing inhibitors against a target, such as the main protease 3CLpro (Mpro), which is highly conserved among all coronaviruses. Here 3CLpro derived from the SARS‐CoV was used as the primary target to identify a new class of inhibitors containing a halomethyl ketone warhead. The compounds are highly potent against SARS 3CLpro with Ki’s as low as 300 nm. The crystal structure of the complex of one of the compounds with 3CLpro indicates that this inhibitor forms a thioether linkage between the halomethyl carbon of the warhead and the catalytic Cys 145. Furthermore, Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) studies of these compounds have led to the identification of a pharmacophore that accurately defines the essential molecular features required for the high affinity.","chemistry"
"Background and Objectives  Pathogen inactivation (PI)‐treated plasma and platelets are increasingly becoming the products of choice, where licensed. This review summarizes the clinical evidence available for licensed component PI technologies and red cell PI under development. Materials and Methods  Available literature on licensed technologies was reviewed. Results  For the plasma and platelets technologies available, evidence for the inactivation of most pathogens is good, except for certain nonenveloped viruses. Clinical trials and haemovigilance programmes suggest the observed loss of potency is of little clinical significance, with some technology‐specific exceptions. Concerns over adverse toxicological effects or neoantigen formation have not been confirmed for currently licensed products. Conclusion  While platelet PI has been adopted to reduce bacterial contamination, the ability of PI methods to replace testing for emerging bloodborne infections, or as a substitute for selective pathogen testing, gamma‐irradiation or even leucodepletion, make adoption of PI for components increasingly attractive.","hematology"
"Over 120 inherited primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are known to exist. The genes responsible for many of these diseases have also been identified. Recent advances in diagnostic procedures have enabled these to be identified earlier and appropriately treated. While a number of approaches are available to identify mutations, direct sequencing remains the gold standard. This approach identifies the exact genetic change with substantial precision. We suggest that a sensitive and economical approach to mutation detection could be the direct sequencing of cDNA followed by the confirmatory sequencing of the corresponding exon. While screening techniques such as single‐stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP), heteroduplex analysis (HA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and denaturing high‐performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) have proven useful, each has inherent advantages and disadvantages. We discuss these advantages and disadvantages and also discuss the potential of future sequencing technologies such as pyrosequencing, combinatorial sequencing‐by‐hybridization, multiplex polymerase colony (polony), and resequencing arrays as tools for future mutation detection. In addition we briefly discuss several high‐throughput SNP detection technologies. Hum Mutat 27(12), 1163–1173, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","genetics"
"Background: The outcome is reported of a prospective uncontrolled study based on a stepwise treatment protocol during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. Method: One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin and low dose corticosteroid, and then intravenous high dose methylprednisolone according to responses. Sustained response to treatment was defined as (1) defervescence for ⩾4 consecutive days, (2) resolution of lung consolidation by >25%, and (3) oxygen independence by the fourth day without fever. Patients with defervescence who achieved either criterion 2 or 3 were classified as partial responders. Patients who fell short of criteria 2 and 3 were non-responders. Results: Laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection was established in 132 (95.7%). None responded to antibiotics but 25 (18.1%) responded to ribavirin + low dose corticosteroid. Methylprednisolone was used in 107 patients, of whom 95 (88.8%) responded favourably. Evidence of haemolytic anaemia was observed in 49 (36%). A high level of C-reactive protein at presentation was the only independent predictor for use of methylprednisolone (odds ratio 2.18 per 10 mg/dl increase, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 4.25, p = 0.02). Thirty seven patients (26.8%) required admission to the intensive care unit and 21 (15.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. There were 15 deaths (mortality rate 10.9%), most with significant co-morbidities, whereas 122 (88.4%) had been discharged home 4 months after the outbreak onset. Conclusion: The use of high dose pulse methylprednisolone during the clinical course of a SARS outbreak was associated with clinical improvement, but randomised controlled trials are needed to ascertain its efficacy in this condition.","respiratory"

"SARS 3C-like proteinase has been proposed to be a key enzyme for drug design against SARS. Lack of a suitable assay has been a major hindrance for enzyme kinetic studies and a large-scale inhibitor screen for SARS 3CL proteinase. Since SARS 3CL proteinase belongs to the cysteine protease family (family C3 in clan CB) with a chymotrypsin fold, it is important to understand the catalytic mechanism of SARS 3CL proteinase to determine whether the proteolysis proceeds through a general base catalysis mechanism like chymotrypsin or an ion pair mechanism like papain. We have established a continuous colorimetric assay for SARS 3CL proteinase and applied it to study the enzyme catalytic mechanism. The proposed catalytic residues His41 and Cys145 were confirmed to be critical for catalysis by mutating to Ala, while the Cys145 to Ser mutation resulted in an active enzyme with a 40-fold lower activity. From the pH dependency of catalytic activity, the pKa's for His41 and Cys145 in the wild-type enzyme were estimated to be 6.38 and 8.34, while the pKa's for His41 and Ser145 in the C145S mutant were estimated to be 6.15 and 9.09, respectively. The C145S mutant has a normal isotope effect in D2O for general base catalysis, that is, reacts slower in D2O, while the wild-type enzyme shows an inverse isotope effect which may come from the lower activation enthalpy. The pKa values measured for the active site residues and the activity of the C145S mutant are consistent with a general base catalysis mechanism and cannot be explained by a thiolate−imidazolium ion pair model.","biochemistry"
"Recently we have described the discovery and complete genome sequence of a novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia, coronavirus HKU1 (CoV‐HKU1). In this study, a detailed in silico analysis of the ORF1ab, encoding the 7,182‐amino acid replicase polyprotein in the CoV‐HKU1 genome showed that the replicase polyprotein of CoV‐HKU1 is cleaved by its papain‐like proteases and 3C‐like protease (3CLpro) into 16 polypeptides homologous to the corresponding polypeptides in other coronaviruses. Surprisingly, analysis of the putative cleavage sites of the 3CLpro revealed a unique putative cleavage site. In all known coronaviruses, the P1 positions at the cleavage sites of the 3CLpro are occupied by glutamine. This is also observed in CoV‐HKU1, except for one site at the junction between nsp10 (helicase) and nsp11 (member of exonuclease family), where the P1 position is occupied by histidine. This amino acid substitution is due to a single nucleotide mutation in the CoV‐HKU1 genome, CAG/A to CAT. This probably represents a novel cleavage site because the same mutation was consistently observed in CoV‐HKU1 sequences from multiple specimens of different patients; the P2 and P1′‐P12′ positions of this cleavage site are consistent between CoV‐HKU1 and other coronaviruses; and as the helicase is one of the most conserved proteins in coronaviruses, cleavage between nsp10 and nsp11 should be an essential step for the generation of the mature functional helicase. Experiments, including purification and C‐terminal amino acid sequencing of the CoV‐HKU1 helicase and trans‐cleavage assays of the CoV‐HKU1 3CLpro will confirm the presence of this novel cleavage site.","microbiology"
"Positive‐stranded RNA viruses, like many other viruses, have evolved to exploit the host cellular machinery to their own advantage. In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin‐proteasome system (UPS) that serves as the major intracellular pathway for protein degradation and modification plays a crucial role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular functions. A growing amount of evidence has suggested that the UPS can be utilized by positive‐sense RNA viruses. The UPS eliminates excess viral proteins that prevent viral replication and modulates the function of viral proteins through post‐translational modification mediated by ubiquitin or ubiquitin‐like proteins. This review will discuss the current understanding of how positive RNA viruses have evolved various mechanisms to usurp the host UPS to modulate the function and stability of viral proteins. In addition to the pro‐viral function, UPS‐mediated viral protein degradation may also constitute a host defense process against some positive‐stranded RNA viral infections. This issue will also be discussed in the current review. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","virology"
"Critical thresholds represent one of the most important diffusion indicators of epidemic outbreaks. However, we believe that recent studies have overemphasized ways that the power-law connectivity distribution features of social networks affect epidemic dynamics and critical thresholds. As a result, two important factors have been overlooked: resource limitations and transmission costs associated with social interactions and daily contact. Here we present our results from the simultaneous application of mean-field theory and an agent-based network simulation approach for analyzing the effects of resources and costs on epidemic dynamics and critical thresholds. Our main findings are: (a) a significant critical threshold does exist when resources and costs are taken into consideration, and it has a lower bound whenever contagion events occur in scale-free networks; (b) when transmission costs increase or individual resources decrease, critical contagion thresholds in scale-free networks grow linearly and steady density curves shrink linearly; (c) regardless of whether the resources of individuals obey delta, uniform, or normal distributions, they have the same critical thresholds and epidemic dynamics as long as the average value of usable resources remains the same across different scale-free networks; and (d) the spread of epidemics in scale-free networks remains controllable as long as resources are properly restricted and intervention strategy investments are significantly increased.","computer"
"The role that bats have played in the emergence of several new infectious diseases has been under review. Bats have been identified as the reservoir hosts of newly emergent viruses such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome–like coronaviruses. This article expands on recent findings about bats and viruses and their relevance to human infections. It briefly reviews the history of chiropteran viruses and discusses their emergence in the context of geography, phylogeny, and ecology. The public health and trade impacts of several outbreaks are also discussed. Finally, we attempt to predict where, when, and why we may see the emergence of new chiropteran viruses.","microbiology"
"A piezoelectric immunosensor was developed for the detection of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in sputum in the gas phase. Horse polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV was bound onto the PZ crystal surface in an ordered orientation through protein A. The antigen sample was atomized into aerosol by an ultrasonator, by which the antibody on the crystal could specifically adsorb SARS antigen and the changed mass of crystal would lead a frequency shift. A frequency counter was employed to record the admittance frequency, and the plot of changed frequency was displayed on the computer. Under the optimized conditions, the frequency shifts were linearly dependent on antigen concentration in the range of 0.6−4 μg/mL. The device has good reproducibility (could be reused 100 times without detectable loss of activity), stability (the immunosensor was stable for more than two months when stored over silica gel blue at 4−6 °C), short analyzing time (less than 2 min), and specificity.","chemistry"
"SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. A key enzyme for the maturation of this virus and, therefore, a target for drug development is the main protease 3CLpro (also termed SARS-CoV 3CLpro). We have cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli the full-length SARS-CoV 3CLpro as well as a truncated form containing only the catalytic domains. The recombinant proteins have been characterized enzymatically using a fluorescently labeled substrate; their structural stability in solution has been determined by differential scanning calorimetry, and novel inhibitors have been discovered. Expression of the catalytic region alone yields a protein with a reduced catalytic efficiency consistent with the proposed regulatory role of the α-helical domain. Differential scanning calorimetry indicates that the α-helical domain does not contribute to the structural stability of the catalytic domains. Analysis of the active site cavity reveals the presence of subsites that can be targeted with specific chemical functionalities. In particular, a cluster of serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) was identified near the active site cavity and was susceptible to being targeted by compounds containing boronic acid. This cluster is highly conserved in similar proteases from other coronaviruses, defining an attractive target for drug development. It was found that bifunctional aryl boronic acid compounds were particularly effective at inhibiting the protease, with inhibition constants as strong as 40 nM. Isothermal titration microcalorimetric experiments indicate that these inhibitors bind reversibly to 3CLpro in an enthalpically favorable fashion, implying that they establish strong interactions with the protease molecule, thus defining attractive molecular scaffolds for further optimization.","biochemistry"
"More than four years have passed since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and still very little is known about the molecular biology and pathogenesis of this deadly virus. Among the accessory proteins of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the 3a protein has been shown to interact with the spike, envelope, and membrane glycoprotein and has recently been established to be a structural component of capsid. Recent studies suggest that the 3a protein may function as an ion channel and may promote virus release. In order to further characterize the functional properties of this protein, we initiated studies to check its RNA binding activity. Using the yeast three-hybrid system, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking techniques, we have shown that the 3a protein is capable of binding specifically to the 5‘ untranslated region (5‘UTR) of the SARS virus genomic RNA. Further, we have mapped the interaction domain of the 3a protein responsible for this RNA−protein interaction using a series of deletion mutants and defined it to the central 75 amino acid region. This RNA binding motif of 3a does not share homology with any other known RNA binding protein and may have an important role in viral capsid assembly and pathogenesis.","biochemistry"
"Infectious diseases caused by viral agents kill millions of people every year. The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus–host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus–Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus–virus, virus–host and host–host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus–virus and virus–host interactions (2671 non-redundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network.

"We report attack rates and contact-related predictors among community contacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases from the 2003 Toronto-area outbreak. Community contact data was extracted from public health records for single, well-defined exposures to a SARS case. In total, 8662 community-acquired exposures resulted in 61 probable cases; a crude attack rate of 0·70% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0·54–0·90]. Persons aged 55–69 years were at higher risk of acquiring SARS (1·14%) than those either younger (0·60%) or older (0·70%). In multivariable analysis exposures for at least 30 min at a distance of ⩽1 m increased the likelihood of becoming a SARS case 20·4-fold (95% CI 11·8–35·1). Risk related to duration of illness in the source case at time of exposure was greatest for illness duration of 7–10 days (rate ratio 3·4, 95% CI 1·9–6·1). Longer and closer proximity exposures incurred the highest rate of disease. Separate measures of time and distance from source cases should be added to minimum datasets for the assessment of interventions for SARS and other emerging diseases.","public"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV) spike (S) protein is the major surface antigen of the virus and is responsible for receptor binding and the generation of neutralizing antibody. To investigate SCoV S protein, full-length and individual domains of S protein were expressed on the surface of insect cells and were characterized for cleavability and reactivity with serum samples obtained from patients during the convalescent phase of SARS. S protein could be cleaved by exogenous trypsin but not by coexpressed furin, suggesting that the protein is not normally processed during infection. Reactivity was evident by both flow cytometry and Western blot assays, but the pattern of reactivity varied according to assay and sequence of the antigen. The antibody response to SCoV S protein involves antibodies to both linear and conformational epitopes, with linear epitopes associated with the carboxyl domain and conformational epitopes associated with the amino terminal domain. Recombinant SCoV S protein appears to be a suitable antigen for the development of an efficient and sensitive diagnostic test for SARS, but our data suggest that assay format and choice of S antigen are important considerations.","microbiology"
"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto and other cities in 2003 showed a heightened sensitivity of places in the global economy to rapid changes brought on by the acceleration of social and ecological relationships. The spread of the SARS virus may be a predictable consequence of these processes. The paper investigates how processes of globalisation have affected the transmission and response to SARS within the context of the global cities network. Little work has been done on the relationship of global city formation and the spread of infectious disease. Arguing that this relationship may be central to understanding the intricate capillary structures of the globalised network, the paper focuses on how pathogens interact with economic, political and social factors. These relationships exist both in the network and in global cities themselves, thereby posing new issues for public health and epidemiological efforts at disease containment and tracking.","urban"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a high rate of mortality. The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent of the disease. Although public health procedures have been effective in combating the spread of SARS, concern remains about the possibility of a recurrence. Various approaches are being pursued for the development of efficacious therapeutics. One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160 000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. The substrate specificity data show the expected P1-Gln P2-Leu specificity and elucidate a novel preference for P1-His containing substrates equal to the expected preference for P1-Gln. These data were then used to develop optimal substrates for a high-throughput screen of a 2000 compound small-molecule inhibitor library consisting of known cysteine protease inhibitor scaffolds. We also report the 1.8 Å X-ray crystal structure of 3Clpro bound to an irreversible inhibitor. This inhibitor, an α,β-epoxyketone, inhibits 3Clpro with a k3/Ki of 0.002 μM-1 s-1 in a mode consistent with the substrate specificity data. Finally, we report the successful rational improvement of this scaffold with second generation inhibitors. These data provide the foundation for a rational small-molecule inhibitor design effort based upon the inhibitor scaffold identified, the crystal structure of the complex, and a more complete understanding of P1−P4 substrate specificity.","biochemistry"
"The therapeutic application of siRNA shows promise as an alternative approach to small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human disease. However, the major obstacle to its use has been the difficulty in delivering these large anionic molecules in vivo. In this study, we have investigated whether siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38 MAP kinase mRNA in mouse lung is influenced by conjugation to the nonviral delivery vector cholesterol and the cell penetrating peptides (CPP) TAT(48−60) and penetratin. Initial studies in the mouse fibroblast L929 cell line showed that siRNA conjugated to cholesterol, TAT(48−60), and penetratin, but not siRNA alone, achieved a limited reduction of p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression. Intratracheal administration of siRNA resulted in localization within macrophages and scattered epithelial cells and produced a 30−45% knockdown of p38 MAP kinase mRNA at 6 h. As with increasing doses of siRNA, conjugation to cholesterol improved upon the duration but not the magnitude of mRNA knockdown, while penetratin and TAT(48−60) had no effect. Importantly, administration of the penetratin or TAT(48−60) peptides alone caused significant reduction in p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression, while the penetratin−siRNA conjugate activated the innate immune response. Overall, these studies suggest that conjugation to cholesterol may extend but not increase siRNA-mediated p38 MAP kinase mRNA knockdown in the lung. Furthermore, the use of CPP may be limited due to as yet uncharacterized effects upon gene expression and a potential for immune activation.","chemistry"
"Background: Polymorphisms of CLEC4M have been associated with predisposition for infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). DC-SIGNR, a C-type lectin encoded by CLEC4M, is a receptor for the virus. A variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in its neck region was recently associated with susceptibility to SARS infection. However, this association was controversial and was not supported by subsequent studies. Two explanations may account for this discrepancy: (1) there may be an unknown predisposition polymorphism located in the proximity which is linked to the VNTR; or (2) it was a spurious association due to unrecognised population structure in the VNTR. Methods: We performed a comprehensively genetic association study on this C-type lectin gene cluster (FCER2, CLEC4G, CD209, and CLEC4M) at 19p13.3 by a tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) approach. Results: 23 tagSNPs were genotyped in 181 SARS patients and 172 population controls. No significant association with disease predisposition was detected. Genetic variations in this cluster also did not predict disease prognosis. However, we detected a population stratification of the VNTR alleles in a sample of 1145 Han Chinese collected from different parts of China. Conclusion: The results indicated that the genetic predisposition allele was not found in this lectin gene cluster and population stratification might cause the previous positive association.","genetics"
"In this study, 221 phytocompounds were evaluated for activity against anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activities using a cell-based assay measuring SARS-CoV-induced cytopathogenic effect on Vero E6 cells. Ten diterpenoids (1−10), two sesquiterpenoids (11 and 12), two triterpenoids (13 and 14), five lignoids (15−19), curcumin (20), and reference controls niclosamide (21) and valinomycin (22) were potent inhibitors at concentrations between 3.3 and 10 μM. The concentrations of the 22 compounds to inhibit 50% of Vero E6 cell proliferation (CC50) and viral replication (EC50) were measured. The selective index values (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 16 were 58, >510, 111, 193, 180, and >667, respectively. Betulinic acid (13) and savinin (16) were competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki values = 8.2 ± 0.7 and 9.1 ± 2.4 μM, respectively. Our findings suggest that specific abietane-type diterpenoids and lignoids exhibit strong anti-SARS-CoV effects.","chemistry"
"Background. Development of vaccines to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is limited by the lack of well-characterized animal models. Previous vaccine reports have noted robust neutralizing antibody and inflammatory responses in ferrets, resulting in enhanced hepatitis. Methods. We evaluated the humoral immune response and pathological end points in ferrets challenged with the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) after having received formalin-inactivated whole-virus vaccine or mock vaccine. Results. Humoral responses were observed in ferrets that received an inactivated virus vaccine. Histopathological findings in lungs showed that infection of ferrets produced residual lung lesions not seen in both mock and vaccinated ferrets. SARS-CoV infection demonstrated bronchial and bronchiolar hyperplasia and perivascular cuffing in ferret lung tissue, as seen previously in infected mice. No evidence of enhanced disease was observed in any of the ferrets. All of the ferrets cleared the virus by day 14, 1 week earlier if vaccinated. Conclusions. The vaccine provided mild immune protection to the ferrets after challenge; however, there was no evidence of enhanced liver or lung disease induced by the inactivated whole-virus vaccine. The ferret may provide another useful model for evaluating SARS vaccine safety and efficacy.","microbiology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain. Analyses of T cell repertoires in health care workers who survived SARS-CoV infection during the 2003 outbreak revealed that their effector memory Vγ9Vδ2 T cell populations were selectively expanded ∼3 months after the onset of disease. No such expansion of their αβ T cell pools was detected. The expansion of the Vγ9Vδ2 T cell population was associated with higher anti–SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G titers. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that stimulated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells display an interferon-γ–dependent anti–SARS-CoV activity and are able to directly kill SARS-CoV–infected target cells. These findings are compatible with the possibility that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells play a protective role during SARS","microbiology"
"Over the last 10 years there have been only a handful of publications dealing with the oral virome, which is in contrast to the oral microbiome, an area that has seen considerable interest. Here, we survey viral infections in general and then focus on those viruses that are found in and/or are transmitted via the oral cavity; norovirus, rabies, human papillomavirus, Epstein‐Barr virus, herpes simplex viruses, hepatitis C virus, and HIV. Increasingly, viral infections have been diagnosed using an oral sample (e.g. saliva mucosal transudate or an oral swab) instead of blood or urine. The results of two studies using a rapid and semi‐quantitative lateral flow assay format demonstrating the correlation of HIV anti‐IgG/sIgA detection with saliva and serum samples are presented. When immediate detection of infection is important, point‐of‐care devices that obtain a non‐invasive sample from the oral cavity can be used to provide a first line diagnosis to assist in determining appropriate counselling and therapeutic path for an increasing number of diseases.","dentistry"
"Viral proteases are essential for pathogenesis and virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Little information is available on SARS-CoV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2), and development of inhibitors against PLP2 is attractive for antiviral therapy. Here, we report the characterization of SARS-CoV PLP2 (from residues 1414 to 1858) purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV PLP2 by itself differentially cleaves between the amino acids Gly180 and Ala181, Gly818 and Ala819, and Gly2740 and Lys2741 of the viral polypeptide pp1a, as determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis coupled with mass spectrometry. This protease is especially selective for the P1, P4, and P6 sites of the substrate. The study demonstrates, for the first time among coronaviral PLPs, that the reaction mechanism of SARS-CoV PLP2 is characteristic of papain and compatible with the involvement of the catalytic dyad (Cys)-S-/(His)-Im+H ion pair. With a fluorogenic inhibitor-screening platform, we show that zinc ion and its conjugates potently inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV PLP2. In addition, we provided evidence for evolutionary reclassification of SARS-CoV. The results provide important insights into the biochemical properties of the coronaviral PLP family and a promising therapeutic way to fight SARS-CoV.","biochemistry"
"Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently identified homologue of ACE that may counterregulate the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II by facilitating its breakdown to Ang 1–7. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis but the role of ACE2 in liver disease is not known. Aims: This study examined the effects of liver injury on ACE2 expression and activity in experimental hepatic fibrosis and human cirrhosis, and the effects of Ang 1–7 on vascular tone in cirrhotic rat aorta. Methods: In sham operated and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess hepatic ACE2 mRNA, and western blotting and immunohistochemistry to quantify and localise ACE2 protein. ACE2 activity was quantified by quenched fluorescent substrate assay. Similar studies were performed in normal human liver and in hepatitis C cirrhosis. Results: ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following BDL (363-fold; p<0.01). ACE2 protein increased after BDL (23.5-fold; p<0.05) as did ACE2 activity (fourfold; p<0.05). In human cirrhotic liver, gene (>30-fold), protein expression (97-fold), and activity of ACE2 (2.4 fold) were increased compared with controls (all p<0.01). In healthy livers, ACE2 was confined to endothelial cells, occasional bile ducts, and perivenular hepatocytes but in both BDL and human cirrhosis there was widespread parenchymal expression of ACE2 protein. Exposure of cultured human hepatocytes to hypoxia led to increased ACE2 expression. In preconstricted rat aorta, Ang 1–7 alone did not affect vascular tone but it significantly enhanced acetylcholine mediated vasodilatation in cirrhotic vessels. Conclusions: ACE2 expression is significantly increased in liver injury in both humans and rat, possibly in response to increasing hepatocellular hypoxia, and may modulate RAS activity in cirrhosis.","gastroenterology"

"Coronavirus (CoV) entry is mediated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein, a class I viral fusion protein. During viral and target cell membrane fusion, the heptad repeat (HR) regions of the S2 subunit assume a trimer-of-hairpins structure, positioning the fusion peptide in close proximity to the C-terminal region of the ectodomain. The formation of this structure appears to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and target cell membranes; however, the exact mechanism is unclear. Here, we characterize an aromatic amino acid rich region within the ectodomain of the S2 subunit that both partitions into lipid membranes and has the capacity to perturb lipid vesicle integrity. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that peptides analogous to the aromatic domains of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)−CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the human CoV OC43 S2 subunits, did not have a propensity for a defined secondary structure. These peptides strongly partitioned into lipid membranes and induced lipid vesicle permeabilization at peptide/lipid ratios of 1:100 in two independent leakage assays. Thus, partitioning of the peptides into the lipid interface is sufficient to disorganize membrane integrity. Our study of the S2 aromatic domain of three CoVs provides supportive evidence for a functional role of this region. We propose that, when aligned with the fusion peptide and transmembrane domains during membrane apposition, the aromatic domain of the CoV S protein functions to perturb the target cell membrane and provides a continuous track of hydrophobic surface, resulting in lipid-membrane fusion and subsequent viral nucleocapsid entry.","biochemistry"
"Summary.  In an outbreak of a completely new infectious disease like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), estimation of the fatality rate over the course of the epidemic is of clinical and epidemiological importance. In contrast with the constant case fatality rate, a new measure, termed the ‘realtime’ fatality rate, is proposed for monitoring the new emerging epidemic at a population level. A competing risk model implemented via a counting process is used to estimate the realtime fatality rate in an epidemic of SARS. It can capture and reflect the time‐varying nature of the fatality rate over the course of the outbreak in a timely and accurate manner. More importantly, it can provide information on the efficacy of a certain treatment and management policy for the disease. The method has been applied to the SARS data from the regions affected, namely Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, Taiwan and Beijing. The magnitudes and patterns of the estimated fatalities are virtually the same except in Beijing, which has a lower rate. It is speculated that the effect is linked to the different treatment protocols that were used. The standard estimate of the case fatality rate that was used by the World Health Organization has been shown to be unable to provide useful information to monitor the time‐varying fatalities that are caused by the epidemic.","social"
"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a newly discovered infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, which can readily spread in the healthcare setting. A recent community outbreak in Hong Kong infected a significant number of pregnant women who subsequently required emergency caesarean section for deteriorating maternal condition and respiratory failure. As no neonatal clinician has any experience in looking after these high risk infants, stringent infection control measures for prevention of cross infection between patients and staff are important to safeguard the wellbeing of the work force and to avoid nosocomial spread of SARS within the neonatal unit.

"Design of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) chymotrypsin‐like protease (3CLpro) is a potentially important approach to fight against SARS. We have developed several synthetic inhibitors by structure‐based drug design. In this report, we reveal two crystal structures of SARS 3CLpro complexed with two new inhibitors based on our previous work. These structures combined with six crystal structures complexed with a series of related ligands reported by us are collectively analyzed. To these eight complexes, the structural basis for inhibitor binding was analyzed by the COMBINE method, which is a chemometrical analysis optimized for the protein–ligand complex. The analysis revealed that the first two latent variables gave a cumulative contribution ratio of r2 = 0.971. Interestingly, scores using the second latent variables for each complex were strongly correlated with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of side‐chain heavy atoms of Met49 from those of the intact crystal structure of SARS‐3CLpro (r = 0.77) enlarging the S2 pocket. The substantial contribution of this side chain (∼10%) for the explanation of pIC50s was dependent on stereochemistry and the chemical structure of the ligand adapted to the S2 pocket of the protease. Thus, starting from a substrate mimic inhibitor, a design for a central scaffold for a low molecular weight inhibitor was evaluated to develop a further potent inhibitor. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Wildlife and fisheries markets are end‐points in the supply chain of both legitimate and illegitimate or unregulated trade in species and natural products. Molecular ecology provides powerful tools for surveillance and estimation of this trade. Here, I review the application of these tools to market surveys and species in trade, including species identification and molecular taxonomy, population assignment and ‘mixed‐stock’ analysis, genetic tracking and capture–recapture by individual identification. I consider the analogy of markets to natural populations and also the unique features that require novel analytical approaches and sampling design. In the most developed of these applications, the molecular ecology of market surveys and confiscated trade shipments has provided independent estimates of illegal, unregulated or unreported exploitation for sharks, elephants and whales. Although each study has taken advantage of information from trade records or official government reports concerning the ostensible levels of exploitation, it is telling that the truer measure of exploitation seems to arise from the market end‐point of the supply chain.","evolutionary"

In addition, several PCR-positive swab samples were recovered from frequently touched surfaces in rooms occupied by patients with SARS (a bed table and a television remote control) and in a nurses’ station used by staff (a medication refrigerator door).

Here we describe a new phylogenetic analytical method to study the sources and dissemination paths of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in Taiwan Methods A phylogenetic analytical tool for combining nucleotide sequences from 6 variable regions of a SARS-CoV genome was developed by use of 20 published SARS-CoV sequences; and this method was validated by use of 80 published SARS-CoV sequences. Subsequently, this new tool was applied to provide a better understanding of the entire complement of Taiwanese SARS-CoV isolates, including 20 previously published and 19 identified in this study. The epidemiological data were integrated with the results from the phylogenetic tree and from the nucleotide-signature pattern Results The topologies of phylogenetic trees generated by the new and the conventional strategies were similar, with the former having better robustness than the latter, especially in comparison with the maximum-likelihood trees: the new strategy revealed that during 2003 there were 5 waves of epidemic SARS-CoV infection, which belonged to 3 phylogenetic clusters in Taiwan Conclusions The new strategy is more efficient than its conventional counterparts.

"Based on the common characteristic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and highly pathogenic avian influenza and the mechanism of inflammation and fibrosis, it is speculated that there should exist a fundamental pathological rule that severe acute lung injury (ALI)-induced rapid pulmonary fibrosis is caused by various etiological factors, such as SARS coronavirus, H5N1-virus, or other unknown factors, and also by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the most common etiological factor.

Inflammatory damage and fibrosis were evaluated, and the molecular mechanism was analyzed according to Th1/Th2 balance, Sma- and MAD-related proteins (Smads) and signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs) expression. The results suggested that rapid pulmonary fibrosis could be induced by ALI via LPS three-hits. The period from 3—7 days in the LPS group was the first rapid pulmonary fibrosis stage, whereas the second fast fibrosis stage occurred on days 14—21. Th2 cell polarization, Smad4 and Smad7 should be the crucial molecular mechanism of ALI-induced rapid fibrosis. The investigation was not only performed to establish a new rapid pulmonary fibrosis model, but also to provide the elicitation for mechanism of ALI changed into the rapid pulmonary fibrosis.","microbiology"
"Up to 60% of patients who develop severe sepsis in the United States are ⩾65 years of age, and the incidence of sepsis in this population is steadily increasing. Elderly individuals have an increased risk of developing sepsis, compared with younger patients, because of frequent comorbidities, institutionalization, declining performance status, and altered immune function. The clinical presentation of older patients with sepsis is often atypical, leading to a difficult and delayed diagnosis. Although increasing age appears to confer a high risk of death due to severe sepsis, recent evidence shows that many older patients respond well to selected interventions when the interventions are initiated in a timely fashion. Newly published clinical practice guidelines outline key recommendations regarding the treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Clinicians must be aware of the level of evidence in support of various interventions and must keenly screen older survivors for ongoing deficits that will limit their functional recovery.","microbiology"
"The synthesis of isoxazolino‐carbocyclic nornucleosides incorporating a quinoline moiety was tuned through nitrosocarbonyl intermediate chemistry, and a range of adenine analogues were attained through the linear construction of purine heterocyclic rings. The synthesis hinges on exo‐selective 1,3‐dipolar cycloaddition of quinolinenitrile oxide to the 2,3‐oxazanorborn‐5‐enes and simple elaboration of the cycloadducts. The nucleoside derivatives were initially tested for their inhibitory activity against a variety of viruses, including HBV, PTV and Flu A virus H1N1. High antiviral activities were found for compounds 22aA and 22bA in the case of Flu A H1N1.","chemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by the human coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The main viral protease, SARS 3CLpro, is a validated target for the development of antiviral therapies. Since the enzyme is a homodimer and the individual monomers are inactive, two approaches are being used to develop inhibitors:  enzyme activity inhibitors that target the active site and dimerization inhibitors. Dimerization inhibitors are usually targeted to the dimerization interface and need to compete with the attractive forces between subunits to be effective. In this paper, we show that the dimerization of SARS 3CLpro is also under allosteric control and that additional and energetically more favorable target sites away from the dimerization interface may also lead to subunit dissociation. We previously identified a cluster of conserved serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) located adjacent to the active site of 3CLpro that could effectively be targeted to inactivate the protease [Bacha, U et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 4906−4912]. Mutation of any of these serine residues to alanine had a debilitating effect on the catalytic activity of 3CLpro. In particular, the mutation of Ser147, which does not make any contact with the opposing subunit and is located approximately 9 Å away from the dimer interface, totally inhibited dimerization and resulted in a complete loss of enzymatic activity. The finding that residues away from the dimer interface are able to control dimerization defines alternative targets for the design of dimerization inhibitors.","biochemistry"

"BackgroundThe goal of this study was to characterize viral loads and factors affecting viral clearance in persons with severe influenza MethodsThis was a 1-year prospective, observational study involving consecutive adults hospitalized with influenza. Nasal and throat swabs were collected at presentation, then daily until 1 week after symptom onset. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to determine viral RNA concentration and virus isolation were performed. Viral RNA concentration was analyzed using multiple linear or logistic regressions or mixed-effect models ResultsOne hundred forty-seven inpatients with influenza A (H3N2) infection were studied (mean age ± standard deviation, 72±16 years). Viral RNA concentration at presentation positively correlated with symptom scores and was significantly higher than that among time-matched outpatients (control subjects). Patients with major comorbidities had high viral RNA concentration even when presenting >2 days after symptom onset (mean ± standard deviation, 5.06±1.85 vs 3.62±2.13 log10 copies/mL; P=.005; β, +0.86 [95% confidence interval, +0.03 to +1.68]). Viral RNA concentration demonstrated a nonlinear decrease with time; 26% of oseltamivir-treated and 57% of untreated patients had RNA detected at 1 week after symptom onset. Oseltamivir started on or before symptom day 4 was independently associated with an accelerated decrease in viral RNA concentration (mean β [standard error], −1.19 [0.43] and −0.68 [0.33] log10 copies/mL for patients treated on day 1 and days 2–3, respectively; P<.05) and viral RNA clearance at 1 week (odds ratio, 0.10 [95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.35] and 0.30 [0.10–0.90] for patients treated on day 1–2 and day 3–4, respectively). Conversely, major comorbidities and systemic corticosteroid use for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations were associated with slower viral clearance. Viral RNA clearance was associated with a shorter hospital stay (7.0 vs 13.5 days; P=.001) ConclusionPatients hospitalized with severe influenza have more active and prolonged viral replication. Weakened host defenses slow viral clearance, whereas antivirals started within the first 4 days of illness enhance viral clearance","microbiology"
"Human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (hSARS‐CoV) is the causative agent for SARS infection. Its surface glycoprotein (spike protein) is considered to be one of the prime targets for SARS therapeutics and intervention because its proteolytic maturation by a host protease is crucial for host–virus fusion. Using intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic (IQF) peptides based on hSARS‐CoV spike protein (Abz‐755Glu‐Gln‐Asp‐Arg‐Asn‐Thr‐Arg‐Glu‐Val‐Phe‐Ala‐Gln766‐Tyx‐NH2) and in vitro studies, we show that besides furin, other PCs, like PC5 and PC7, might also be involved in this cleavage event. Through kinetic measurements with recombinant PCs, we observed that the peptide was cleaved efficiently by both furin and PC5, but very poorly by PC7. The cleavage could be blocked by a PC‐inhibitor, α1‐PDX, in a dose‐dependent manner. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that this peptide possesses a high degree of sheet structure. Following cleavage by furin, the sheet content increased, possibly at the expense of turn and random structures. 1H NMR spectra from 2D COSY and ROESY experiments under physiological buffer and pH conditions indicated that this peptide possesses a structure with a turn at its C‐terminal segment, close to the cleavage site. The data suggest that the cleavable peptide bond is located within the most exposed domain; this is supported by the nearby turn structure. Several strong to weak NMR ROESY correlations were detected, and a 3D structure of the spike IQF peptide that contains the crucial cleavage site R761↓E has been proposed.","chemistry"
"XendoU is the first endoribonuclease described in higher eukaryotes as being involved in the endonucleolytic processing of intron‐encoded small nucleolar RNAs. It is conserved among eukaryotes and its viral homologue is essential in SARS replication and transcription. The large‐scale purification and crystallization of recombinant XendoU are reported. The tendency of the recombinant enzyme to aggregate could be reversed upon the addition of chelating agents (EDTA, imidazole): aggregation is a potential drawback when purifying and crystallizing His‐tagged proteins, which are widely used, especially in high‐throughput structural studies. Purified monodisperse XendoU crystallized in two different space groups: trigonal P3121, diffracting to low resolution, and monoclinic C2, diffracting to higher resolution.","crystallography"
"Potassium ion (K+) channels are attractive targets for drug discovery because of the essential roles played in biological systems. However, high-throughput screening (HTS) cannot be used to screen K+ channel blockers. To overcome this disadvantage of HTS, we have developed a virtual screening approach for discovering novel blockers of K+ channels. On the basis of a three-dimensional model of the eukaryotic K+ channels, molecular docking-based virtual screening was employed to search the chemical database MDL Available Chemicals Directory (ACD). Compounds were ranked according to their relative binding energy, favorable shape complementarity, and potential to form hydrogen bonds with the outer mouth of the K+ channel model. Twenty candidate compounds selected from the virtual screening were examined using the whole-cell voltage-clamp recording in rat dissociated hippocampal neurons. Among them, six compounds (5, 6, 8, 18−20) potently blocked both the delayed rectifier (IK) and fast transient K+ currents (IA). When applied externally, these six compounds preferentially blocked IK with potencies 2- to 500-fold higher than that of tetraethylammonium chloride. Intracellular application of the six compounds had no effect on both K+ currents. In addition, the interaction models and binding free energy calculations demonstrated that hydrophobic interaction and solvent effects play important roles in the inhibitory activities of these compounds. The results demonstrated that structure-based computer screening strategy could be used to identify novel, structurally diverse compounds targeting the pore binding pocket of the outer mouth of voltage-gated K+ channels. This study provides an alternative way of finding new blockers of voltage-gated K+ channels, while the techniques for high-throughput screening of K+ channel drugs remain in development.","chemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by infection with a novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), was the first major novel infectious disease at the beginning of the 21st century, with China especially affected. SARS was characterized by high infectivity, morbidity and mortality, and the confined pattern of the disease spreading among the countries of South‐East and East Asia suggested the existence of susceptible factor(s) in these populations. Studies in the populations of Hong Kong and Taiwan showed an association of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms with the development and/or severity of SARS, respectively. The aim of the present study was to define the genotypic patterns of HLA‐A, ‐B and ‐DRB1 loci in SARS patients and a co‐resident population of Guangdong province, southern China, where the first SARS case was reported. The samples comprised 95 cases of recovered SARS patients and 403 unrelated healthy controls. HLA ‐A, ‐B and ‐DRB1 alleles were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction with sequence‐specific primers. The severity of the disease was assessed according to the history of lung infiltration, usage of assisted ventilation and occurrence of lymphocytopenia. Although the allelic frequencies of A23, A34, B60, DRB1*12 in the SARS group were slightly higher, and A33, ‐B58 and ‐B61 were lower than in the controls, no statistical significance was found when the Pc value was considered. Similarly, no association of HLA alleles with the severity of the disease was detected. Thus, variations in the major histocompatibility complex are unlikely to have contributed significantly to either the susceptibility or the severity of SARS in the population of Guangdong.","immunology"

"The purpose of this article is to quantify the public health risk associated with inhalation of indoor airborne infection based on a probabilistic transmission dynamic modeling approach. We used the Wells‐Riley mathematical model to estimate (1) the CO2 exposure concentrations in indoor environments where cases of inhalation airborne infection occurred based on reported epidemiological data and epidemic curves for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), (2) the basic reproductive number, R0 (i.e., expected number of secondary cases on the introduction of a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population) and its variability in a shared indoor airspace, and (3) the risk for infection in various scenarios of exposure in a susceptible population for a range of R0. We also employ a standard susceptible‐infectious‐recovered (SIR) structure to relate Wells‐Riley model derived R0 to a transmission parameter to implicate the relationships between indoor carbon dioxide concentration and contact rate. We estimate that a single case of SARS will infect 2.6 secondary cases on average in a population from nosocomial transmission, whereas less than 1 secondary infection was generated per case among school children. We also obtained an estimate of the basic reproductive number for influenza in a commercial airliner: the median value is 10.4. We suggest that improving the building air cleaning rate to lower the critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air can decrease transmission rate. Here, we show that virulence of the organism factors, infectious quantum generation rates (quanta/s by an infected person), and host factors determine the risk for inhalation of indoor airborne infection.","social"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious respiratory illness caused by a novel human coronavirus. The disease is highly infectious and carries significant mortality and morbidity. There was a major outbreak of SARS in Guangdong, Taiwan, Beijing, Hong Kong and Toronto between March and June 2003. Common presenting features of SARS are high fever, chills, rigor, malaise, nonproductive cough, lymphopenia and pulmonary infiltrates, followed by rapidly progressive respiratory failure in some cases. We describe two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who presented with fever, systemic upset and pulmonary infiltrates between April and June, 2003. One patient was confirmed to have coronavirus pneumonia while the other had active SLE with lung involvement. Our cases illustrate the difficult diagnostic dilemma in the evaluation of febrile SLE patients during the SARS epidemic.","rheumatology"
"The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) raised questions about the risk of importation of such infection, in particular by air travel. Entry screening was implemented in some countries although poor evidence on its effectiveness is reported. We developed a model to estimate the number of imported SARS cases between regions, using the 2003 SARS epidemic data to apply this model for two scenarios: from Beijing to Frankfurt and from Hong Kong to London. We back-calculated the data to estimate individuals’ time of infection and built a model where every individual has a probability of being isolated, of traveling, and of being undetected at arrival. The findings, consistent with what was observed in 2003, suggest that entry screening does not affect the predicted number of imported cases. Inversely, importation depends on the transmission dynamic in the country of origin (including control measures in place) and on the intensity of air travel between regions.","public"
"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted bunyavirus (genus Phlebovirus) associated with severe disease in livestock and fatal encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever in a proportion of infected humans. Although live attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been used in livestock, and on a limited scale in humans, there is a need for improved anti-RVFV vaccines. Towards this goal, Sindbis virus replicon vectors expressing the RVFV Gn and Gc glycoproteins, as well as the non-structural nsM protein, were constructed and evaluated for their ability to induce protective immune responses against RVFV. These replicon vectors were shown to produce the RVFV glycoproteins to high levels in vitro and to induce systemic anti-RVFV antibody responses in immunized mice, as determined by RVFV-specific ELISA, fluorescent antibody tests, and demonstration of a neutralizing antibody response. Replicon vaccination also provided 100% protection against lethal RVFV challenge by either the intraperitoneal or intranasal route. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that the replicon vectors elicit RVFV-specific neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated sheep. These results suggest that alphavirus-based replicon vectors can induce protective immunity against RVFV, and that this approach merits further investigation into its potential utility as a RVFV vaccine.","public"
"Background. Nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens are commonly used for the detection of respiratory viruses, but throat and saliva specimens are easier to obtain. The objective of this study was to compare the viral yield of direct fluorescent antigen detection of NP specimens and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT) of direct fluorescent antigen-negative NP specimens with the viral yield of NAT of throat swab and saliva specimens. Methods. NP, throat swab, and saliva specimens were obtained from children and adolescents aged ⩽17 years. Direct fluorescent antigen testing of the NP specimen for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, and parainfluenza virus was performed. If no virus was detected, NAT was performed for these 4 viruses, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. If a virus was detected by either method, NAT for the same virus was performed for the corresponding throat swab and saliva specimens. Results. A virus was detected in 105 of the 137 NP specimens. The same virus was detectable by NAT in 87 (83%) of 105 throat swab specimens and 77 (74%) of 104 saliva specimens. The likelihood of viral detection among throat swab and saliva swab specimens was higher when the NP specimen tested positive by direct fluorescent antigen testing, compared with NAT alone, and when the specimens were obtained within 3 days after symptom onset, compared with later in the illness. Conclusions. Throat swab and saliva specimens are inferior to NP specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses but might be acceptable for screening in a setting where it is impractical to obtain an NP specimen.","microbiology"
"3C-like protease (3CLpro) plays pivotal roles in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and only the dimeric protease is proposed as the functional form. Guided by the crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations, we performed systematic mutation analyses to identify residues critical for 3CLpro dimerization and activity in this study. Seven residues on the dimer interface were selected for evaluating their contributions to dimer stability and catalytic activity by biophysical and biochemical methods. These residues are involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding and broadly located in the N-terminal finger, the α-helix A′ of domain I, and the oxyanion loop near the S1 substrate-binding subsite in domain II. We revealed that all seven single mutated proteases still have the dimeric species but the monomer–dimer equilibria of these mutants vary from each other, implying that these residues might contribute differently to the dimer stability. Such a conclusion could be further verified by the results that the proteolytic activities of these mutants also decrease to varying degrees. The present study would help us better understand the dimerization-activity relationship of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and afford potential information for designing anti-viral compounds targeting the dimer interface of the protease.","biochemistry"
"Multicellular organisms are similar to biological communities, consisting of various cell types; thus, inter‐cell communication is critical for the functioning of the whole system that ultimately constitutes a living being. Conventional models of cellular exchange include signaling molecules and direct contact‐mediated cell communications. Exosomes, small vesicles originating from an inward budding of the plasma membrane, represent a new avenue for signaling between cells. This interchange is achieved by packaging RNA species into exosomes endowed with specific cell surface‐targeting motifs. The delivered RNA molecules are functional, and mRNA can be translated into new proteins, while microRNAs (miRNAs) target host mRNAs in the recipient cell. RNA involved in transmitting information or molecules between cells is called exosomal RNA (esRNA). This review summarizes the characteristics of exosomes, specifically focusing on their role in the horizontal transfer of cellular information.

"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) became a worldwide outbreak with a mortality of 9.2%. This new human emergent infectious disease is dominated by severe lower respiratory illness and is aetiologically linked to a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Methods: Pulmonary pathology and clinical correlates were investigated in seven patients who died of SARS in whom there was a strong epidemiological link. Investigations include a review of clinical features, morphological assessment, histochemical and immunohistochemical stainings, ultrastructural study, and virological investigations in postmortem tissue. Results: Positive viral culture for coronavirus was detected in most premortem nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (five of six) and postmortem lung tissues (two of seven). Viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, could be detected in lung pneumocytes in most of the patients. These features suggested that pneumocytes are probably the primary target of infection. The pathological features were dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, with the presence of multinucleated pneumocytes. Fibrogranulation tissue proliferation in small airways and airspaces (bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia-like lesions) in subpleural locations was also seen in some patients. Conclusions: Viable SARS-CoV could be isolated from postmortem tissues. Postmortem examination allows tissue to be sampled for virological investigations and ultrastructural examination, and when coupled with the appropriate lung morphological changes, is valuable to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV, particularly in clinically unapparent or suspicious but unconfirmed cases.","pathology"
"Ginger is one of the most commonly used fresh herbs and spices. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT)-induced diarrhea is the leading cause of infant death in developing countries. In this study, we demonstrated that ginger significantly blocked the binding of LT to cell-surface receptor GM1, resulting in the inhibition of fluid accumulation in the closed ileal loops of mice. Biological-activity-guided searching for active components showed that zingerone (vanillylacetone) was the likely active constituent responsible for the antidiarrheal efficacy of ginger. Further analysis of chemically synthesized zingerone derivatives revealed that compound 31 (2-[(4-methoxybenzyl)oxy]benzoic acid) significantly suppressed LT-induced diarrhea in mice via an excellent surface complementarity with the B subunits of LT. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that ginger and its derivatives may be effective herbal supplements for the clinical treatment of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhea.","food"
"In Staphylococcus aureus, virulence and colonization-associated surface proteins are covalently anchored to the cell wall by the transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA). In order to better understand the contribution of specific active site residues to substrate recognition and catalysis, we performed mutational analysis of several key residues in the SrtA active site. Analysis of protein stability, kinetic parameters, solvent isotope effects, and pH−rate profiles for key SrtA variants are consistent with a reverse protonated Cys184-His120 catalytic dyad, and implicate a role for Arg197 in formation of an oxyanion hole to stabilize the transition state. In contrast, mutation of Asp185 and Asp186 produced negligible effects on catalysis, and no evidence was found to support the existence of a functional catalytic triad. Mutation of Thr180, Leu181, and Ile182 to alanine produced modest decreases in SrtA activity and led to substrate inhibition. Thermodynamic stability measurements by SUPREX (stability of unpurified proteins from rates of H/D exchange) revealed decreases in conformational stability that correlate with the observed substrate inhibition for each variant, signifying a potential role for the conserved 180TLITC184 motif in defining the active-site architecture of SrtA. In contrast, mutation of Thr183 to alanine led to a significant 1200-fold decrease in kcat, which appears to be unrelated to conformational stability. Potential explanations for these results are discussed, and a revised model for SrtA catalysis is presented.","biochemistry"
"The genetic structure of populations of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in East Asia was assessed by making host range and gene sequence comparisons of 118 isolates utilizing a population genetic approach. Most, but not all, isolates collected from Brassica plants in China infected only Brassica plants, whereas those from Japan infected both Brassica and Raphanus (BR) plants. Analyses of the positions of recombination sites in five regions of the genomes (one third of the full sequence) of the many recombinant isolates were fully congruent with the results of phylogenetic analysis, and at least one recombination type pattern was shared between Chinese and Japanese populations. One lineage of nonrecombinant isolates from the basal‐BR lineage was found in 2000 in Kyushu, Japan but none in China, and have since been found over the whole island. The sudden expansion of this basal‐BR population was strongly supported by calculations showing the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the individual geographical lineages with overall lack of nucleotide diversity, and by analysis of mismatch distribution. Our study shows that the recent Chinese and Japanese TuMV isolates are part of the same population but are discrete lineages.","evolutionary"
"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described form of atypical pneumonia linked to a novel coronavirus. Aims: To review the sputum cytology of 15 patients who fulfilled the World Health Organisation clinical criteria for SARS in an attempt to evaluate whether early diagnosis is feasible with routine sputum examination. Methods: All sputum samples from patients with SARS from the four major hospitals in Hong Kong were reviewed; abnormalities were sought in the cellular component, including abnormal numbers and morphology of the component cells compared with those from age matched controls taken over the same period one year ago. Results: Fifteen sputum samples from patients were compared with 25 control samples. In the patients with SARS, loose aggregates of macrophages were seen more frequently in the sputum. These macrophages frequently showed morphological changes, such as cytoplasmic foaminess, vacuole formation, and nuclear changes (including multinucleation and a ground glass appearance) when compared with the control samples. Conclusions: The cytological features of SARS are non-specific, but the observation of any of the described features should prompt further investigations, especially in patients with suspicious clinical features.","pathology"
"The laboratory diagnosis of dengue has largely relied on serological assays, although many different RT-PCR protocols have been reported. Owing to its limited use, the value of RT-PCR in the clinical laboratory has not been fully evaluated. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore in 2003, RT-PCR to detect dengue viral RNA was used as a rapid diagnostic tool to differentiate dengue from SARS among patients who presented to a hospital designated to manage and quarantine SARS cases. A total of 343 results for RT-PCR and 439 results for serology were analysed and compared with the final discharge diagnosis. Our experience indicates that RT-PCR for dengue can be set up rapidly in a clinical laboratory, with very sensitive and specific results for the diagnosis of dengue, particularly in the first 5 days from onset of symptoms.","public"
"In the last few years more and more studies on the biological properties of essential oils have been published and it seemed worthwhile to compile the studies of 2009, 2008 and the second part of 2007. Such an overview covering the scientific literature mainly from 2000 onwards, up to the first half of the year 2007, has been published recently. The focus of this overview lies on the anti‐nociceptive, anticancer, anti‐inflammatory, penetration‐enhancing, insect repellent, antiviral and antioxidative properties of essential oils. Many essential oils have been used for centuries in folk medicine and in recent years the biological properties of various essential oils have been proved by a number of studies. Their use in the treatment of pain, inflammation, viral diseases and cancer and their potential to enhance the penetration of other drugs, their insect repellent activity and their antioxidative effects were confirmed. Nonetheless, more studies are necessary to analyse the biological properties of other essential oils or to prove their mechanism of action. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","food"
"Dendritic cells are potent antigen‐capture and antigen‐presenting cells that play a key role in the initiation and regulation of the adaptive immune response. This process of immune homeostasis, as maintained by dendritic cells, is susceptible to dysregulation by certain pathogens during chronic infections. Such dysregulation may lead to disease perpetuation with potentially severe systemic consequences. Here we discuss in detail how intracellular pathogens exploit dendritic cells and escape degradation by altering or evading autophagy. This novel mechanism explains, in part, the chronic, persistent nature observed in several immuno‐inflammatory diseases, including periodontal disease. We also propose a hypothetical model of the plausible role of autophagy in the context of periodontal disease. Promotion of autophagy may open new therapeutic strategies in the search of a ‘cure’ for periodontal disease in humans.","dentistry"
"The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. It spread rapidly to many countries and developing a SARS vaccine is now urgently required. In order to study the immunogenicity of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion as a vaccine candidate, we subcutaneously immunized mice with UV-inactivated SARS-CoV with or without an adjuvant. We chose aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) as an adjuvant, because of its long safety history for human use. We observed that the UV-inactivated SARS-CoV virion elicited a high level of humoral immunity, resulting in the generation of long-term antibody secreting and memory B cells. With the addition of alum to the vaccine formula, serum IgG production was augmented and reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice, though it was still insufficient to elicit serum IgA antibodies. Notably, the SARS-CoV virion itself was able to induce long-term antibody production even without an adjuvant. Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the virus and were able to neutralize the virus. Furthermore, the UV-inactivated virion induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation and significant levels of cytokine production (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon restimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV virion in vitro. Thus, a whole killed virion could serve as a candidate antigen for a SARS vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immunity.","immunology"
"Most coronaviruses cause respiratory or intestinal infections in their animal or human host. Hence, their interaction with polarized epithelial cells plays a critical role in the onset and outcome of infection. In this paper, we review the knowledge regarding the entry and release of coronaviruses, with particular emphasis on the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. As these viruses approach the epithelial surfaces from the apical side, it is not surprising that coronavirus cell receptors are exposed primarily on the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells. With respect to release, all possibilities appear to occur. Thus, most coronaviruses exit through the apical surface, several through the basolateral one, although the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus appears to use both sides. These observations help us understand the local or systematic spread of the infection within its host as well as the spread of the virus within the host population.

"DNA resequencing arrays enable rapid acquisition of high-quality sequence data. This technology represents a promising platform for rapid high-resolution genotyping of microorganisms. Traditional array-based resequencing methods have relied on the use of specific PCR-amplified fragments from the query samples as hybridization targets. While this specificity in the target DNA population reduces the potential for artifacts caused by cross-hybridization, the subsampling of the query genome limits the sequence coverage that can be obtained and therefore reduces the technique's resolution as a genotyping method. We have developed and validated an Affymetrix Inc. GeneChip® array-based, whole-genome resequencing platform for Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. A set of bioinformatic filters that targeted systematic base-calling errors caused by cross-hybridization between the whole-genome sample and the array probes and by deletions in the sample DNA relative to the chip reference sequence were developed. Our approach eliminated 91% of the false-positive single-nucleotide polymorphism calls identified in the SCHU S4 query sample, at the cost of 10.7% of the true positives, yielding a total base-calling accuracy of 99.992%.","biochemistry"
"A predator–prey model with disease infection in both populations is proposed to account for the possibility of a contagious disease crossing species barrier from prey to predator. We obtain several threshold parameters from local analysis of various equilibria of the proposed system as well as coupled conditions on these threshold parameters which determine the stability of these equilibria. One of the coupled conditions, in the form of an ecological threshold number for the predator–prey ecosystem, always determines the coexistence of predators and prey. The other condition, in the form of a disease basic reproduction number, dictates whether the disease will become endemic in the ecosystem. Under one combination of these coupled conditions, a highly infectious disease could drive the predators to extinction when predators and prey would have coexisted without the disease. For another combination of the conditions, the predation of the more vulnerable infected prey could cause the disease to be eradicated in the ecosystem, in some case even approaching a disease-free periodic solution, when the disease would have otherwise remained endemic in the prey population in the absence of predation. This indicates that the presence of disease in both predators and prey could either promote or impair coexistence, and its precise impact needs to be explored specifically in each particular situation. By considering disease infection in both populations, our model also yields more complex dynamics, allowing for the possibility of bistability and periodic oscillation, in either disease-free or endemic states, in the ecosystem for which the conditions are obtained analytically and with the help of numerical simulations.","mathematical"

Viral RNA was isolated at post mortem from the jejunum and liver of a cat with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). A consensus sequence of the jejunum-derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Je) was determined from overlapping cDNA fragments produced by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. RT-PCR products were sequenced by a reiterative sequencing strategy and the genomic RNA termini were determined using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR strategy. The FCoV C1Je genome was found to be 29,255 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail. Comparison of the FCoV C1Je genomic RNA sequence with that of the laboratory strain FCoV FIP virus (FIPV) 79-1146 showed that both viruses have a similar genome organisation and predictions made for the open reading frames and cis-acting elements of the FIPV 79-1146 genome hold true for FCoV C1Je. In addition, the sequence of the 3′-proximal third of the liver derived genomic RNA (FCoV C1Li), which encompasses the structural and accessory protein genes of the virus, was also determined. Comparisons of the enteric (jejunum) and non-enteric (liver) derived viral RNA sequences revealed 100% nucleotide identity, a finding that questions the well accepted ‘internal mutation theory’ of FIPV pathogenicity.","veterinary"
"Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. All current therapies of hepatitis C include interferon‐alpha (IFN‐α). Moreover, IFN‐gamma (IFN‐γ), the only type II IFN, strongly inhibits HCV replication in vitro and is the primary mediator of HCV‐specific antiviral T‐cell responses. However, for both cytokines the precise set of effector protein(s) responsible for replication inhibition is not known. The aim of this study was the identification of IFN‐α and IFN‐γ stimulated genes (ISGs) responsible for controlling HCV replication. We devised an RNA interference (RNAi)‐based “gain of function” screen and identified, in addition to known ISGs earlier reported to suppress HCV replication, several new ones with proven antiviral activity. These include IFIT3 (IFN‐induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3), TRIM14 (tripartite motif containing 14), PLSCR1 (phospholipid scramblase 1), and NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2, inducible). All ISGs identified in this study were up‐regulated both by IFN‐α and IFN‐γ, demonstrating a substantial overlap of HCV‐specific effectors induced by either cytokine. Nevertheless, some ISGs were more specific for IFN‐α or IFN‐γ, which was most pronounced in case of PLSCR1 and NOS2 that were identified as main effectors of IFN‐γ‐mediated anti‐HCV activity. Combinatorial knockdowns of ISGs suggest additive or synergistic effects demonstrating that with either IFN, inhibition of HCV replication is caused by the combined action of multiple ISGs. Conclusion: Our study identifies a number of novel ISGs contributing to the suppression of HCV replication by type I and type II IFN. We demonstrate a substantial overlap of antiviral programs triggered by either cytokine and show that suppression of HCV replication is mediated by the concerted action of multiple effectors.

"Understanding how evolution promotes pathogen emergence would aid disease management, and prediction of future host shifts. Increased pathogen infectiousness of different hosts may occur through direct selection, or fortuitously via indirect selection. However, it is unclear which type of selection tends to produce host breadth promoting pathogen emergence. We predicted that direct selection for host breadth should foster emergence by causing higher population growth on new hosts, lower among‐population variance in growth on new hosts, and lower population variance in growth across new hosts. We tested the predictions using experimentally evolved vesicular stomatitis virus populations, containing groups of host‐use specialists, directly selected generalists, and indirectly selected generalists. In novel‐host challenges, viruses directly selected for generalism showed relatively higher or equivalent host growth, lower among‐population variance in host growth, and lower population variance in growth across hosts. Thus, two of three outcomes supported our prediction that directly selected host breadth should favor host colonization. Also, we observed that indirectly selected generalists were advantaged over specialist viruses, indicating that fortuitous changes in host breadth may also promote emergence. We discuss evolution of phenotypic plasticity versus environmental robustness in viruses, virus avoidance of extinction, and surveillance of pathogen niche breadth to predict future likelihood of emergence.","genetics"

Jordan‐Sciutto (2012) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology38, 175–200 Activation status of integrated stress response pathways in neurones and astrocytes of HIV‐associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cortex Aims: Combined anti‐retroviral therapy (cART) has led to a reduction in the incidence of HIV‐associated dementia (HAD), a severe motor/cognitive disorder afflicting HIV(+) patients. However, the prevalence of subtler forms of neurocognitive dysfunction, which together with HAD are termed HIV‐associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), continues to escalate in the post‐cART era. The microgliosis, astrogliosis, dendritic damage, and synaptic and neuronal loss observed in autopsy cases suggest an underlying neuroinflammatory process, due to the neurotoxic factors released by HIV‐infected/activated macrophages/microglia in the brain, might underlie the pathogenesis of HAND in the post‐cART era. These factors are known to induce the integrated stress response (ISR) in several neurodegenerative diseases; we have previously shown that BiP, an indicator of general ISR activation, is upregulated in cortical autopsy tissue from HIV‐infected patients. The ISR is composed of three pathways, each with its own initiator protein: PERK, IRE1α and ATF6. Methods: To further elucidate the specific ISR pathways activated in the central nervous system of HAND patients, we examined the protein levels of several ISR proteins, including ATF6, peIF2α and ATF4, in cortical tissue from HIV‐infected patients. Results: The ISR does not respond in an all‐or‐none fashion in HAND, but rather demonstrates a nuanced activation pattern. Specifically, our studies implicate the ATF6 pathway of the ISR as a more likely candidate than the PERK pathway for increases in BiP levels in astrocytes. Conclusion: These findings begin to characterize the nature of the ISR response in HAND and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention in this disease.","pathology"
"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is currently spreading in many countries. This paper proposes a simple approximate mathematical model for public health practitioners to predict the number of SARS cases and deaths. Methods: The model is based on four parameters: Ro (basic reproductive number), F (case-fatality rate), i (incubation period), and d (duration of disease). The calculations can be done by hand or by using a computer spreadsheet. Results: The best parameters to fit Canadian data as of 6 April 2003 (before infection controls took effect) are Ro = 1.5, F = 30%, i = 5 days, d = 14 days. On 6 April (day 40) there were 74 cases and 7 deaths. If this trend continues, SARS numbers in Canada are predicted to be as follows: 387 cases and 34 deaths by 26 April (day 60), 4432 cases and 394 deaths by 26 May (day 90), and 50 500 cases and 4489 deaths by 25 June (day 120). By comparison, the best parameters to fit Hong Kong data as of 10 April 2003 are Ro = 2.0, F = 20%, i = 5 days, d = 14 days. Conclusions: Using the proposed mathematical model, it was estimated that about 1.5 to 2 new infectious cases were produced per infectious case every five days. Also, about 20% to 30% of the cases die within 14 days. The case-fatality may therefore be considerably higher than initially thought. The model indicates that SARS can spread very fast when there are no interventions.","public"
"Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis, Mafa) have emerged as an important animal model for infectious disease and transplantation research. Extensive characterization of their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphism regions therefore becomes urgently required. In this study, we identified 41 MHC class I A nucleotide sequences in 34 unrelated cynomolgus macaques of Vietnamese origin farmed in Southern China, including eight novel Mafa‐A sequences. We found two sequences with perfect identity and six sequences with close similarity to previously defined MHC class I alleles from other populations, especially from Indonesian‐origin macaques. We also found three Vietnamese‐origin cynomolgus macaque MHC class I sequences for which the predicted protein sequences identical throughout their B and F binding pockets to Mamu‐A1*001:01 and Mamu‐A3*13:03, respectively. This is important because Mamu‐A1*001:01 and Mamu‐A3*13:03 are associated with longer survival and lower set‐point viral load in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)‐infected rhesus monkeys. These findings have implications for the evolutionary history of Vietnamese‐origin cynomolgus macaque as well as for the use of this model in SIV/SHIV (a virus combining parts of the HIV and SIV genomes) research.","pathology"
"Background. An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in our 22-bed intensive care unit (ICU; Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, HKSAR, China) from 12 March to 31 May 2003, when only patients with SARS were admitted. This period was characterized by the upgrading of infection control precautions, which included the wearing of gloves and gowns all the time, an extensive use of steroids, and a change in antibiotic prescribing practices. The pattern of endemic pathogenic organisms, the rates of acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were compared with those of the pre-SARS and post-SARS periods. Methods. Data on pathogenic isolates were obtained from the microbiology department (Prince of Wales Hospital). Data on MRSA acquisition and VAP rates were collected prospectively. MRSA screening was performed for all ICU patients. A case of MRSA carriage was defined as an instance in which MRSA was recovered from any site in a patient, and cases were classified as imported or ICU-acquired if the first MRSA isolate was recovered within 72 h of ICU admission or after 72 h in the ICU, respectively. Results. During the SARS period in the ICU, there was an increase in the rate of isolation of MRSA and Stenotrophomonas and Candida species but a disappearance of Pseudomonas and Klebsiella species. The MRSA acquisition rate was also increased: it was 3.53% (3.53 cases per 100 admissions) during the pre-SARS period, 25.30% during the SARS period, and 2.21% during the post-SARS period (P < .001). The VAP rate was high, at 36.5 episodes per 1000 ventilator-days, and 47% of episodes were caused by MRSA. Conclusions. A SARS outbreak in the ICU led to changes in the pathogen pattern and the MRSA acquisition rate. The data suggest that MRSA cross-transmission may be increased if gloves and gowns are worn all the time.","microbiology"
"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, which encode polycystin‐1 (PC1) and polycystin‐2 (PC2), respectively. Earlier work has shown that PC1 and PC2 assemble into a polycystin complex implicated in kidney morphogenesis. PC2 also assembles into homomers of uncertain functional significance. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that direct polycystin complex assembly and specify its functions. We have identified a coiled coil in the C‐terminus of PC2 that functions as a homodimerization domain essential for PC1 binding but not for its self‐oligomerization. Dimerization‐defective PC2 mutants were unable to reconstitute PC1/PC2 complexes either at the plasma membrane (PM) or at PM‐endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions but could still function as ER Ca2+‐release channels. Expression of dimerization‐defective PC2 mutants in zebrafish resulted in a cystic phenotype but had lesser effects on organ laterality. We conclude that C‐terminal dimerization of PC2 specifies the formation of polycystin complexes but not formation of ER‐localized PC2 channels. Mutations that affect PC2 C‐terminal homo‐ and heteromerization are the likely molecular basis of cyst formation in ADPKD.","cell"
"Background. Avian H5N1 influenza A virus is an emerging pathogen with the potential to cause substantial human morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the ability of currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccine to confer cross-protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in mice. Methods. BALB/c mice were inoculated 3 times, either intranasally or subcutaneously, with the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine licensed in Japan for the 2005–2006 season. The vaccine included A/NewCaledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/NewYork/55/2004 (H3N2), and B/Shanghai/361/2002 viral strains and was administered together with poly(I):poly(C12U) (Ampligen) as an adjuvant. At 14 days after the final inoculation, the inoculated mice were challenged with either the A/HongKong/483/97, the A/Vietnam/1194/04, or the A/Indonesia/6/05 strain of H5N1 influenza virus. Results. Compared with noninoculated mice, those inoculated intranasally manifested cross-reactivity of mucosal IgA and serum IgG with H5N1 virus, as well as both a reduced H5N1 virus titer in nasal-wash samples and increased survival, after challenge with H5N1 virus. Subcutaneous inoculation did not induce a cross-reactive IgA response and did not afford protection against H5N1 viral infection. Conclusions. Intranasal inoculation with annual influenza vaccine plus the Toll-like receptor—3 agonist, poly(I): poly(C12U), may overcome the problem of a limited supply of H5N1 virus vaccine by providing cross-protective mucosal immunity against H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential.","microbiology"
"The contribution of viruses to lower respiratory tract disease in sub‐Saharan Africa where human immunodeficiency virus may exacerbate respiratory infections is not well defined. No data exist on some of these viruses for Southern Africa. Comprehensive molecular screening may define the role of these viruses as single and co‐infections in a population with a high HIV‐AIDS burden. To address this, children less than 5 years of age with respiratory infections from 3 public sector hospitals, Pretoria South Africa were screened for 14 respiratory viruses, by PCR over 2 years. Healthy control children from the same region were included. Rhinovirus was identified in 33% of patients, RSV (30.1%), PIV‐3 (7.8%), hBoV (6.1%), adenovirus (5.7%), hMPV (4.8%), influenza A (3.4%), coronavirus NL63 (2.1%), and OC43 (1.8%). PIV‐1, PIV‐2, CoV‐229E, ‐HKU1, and influenza B occurred in <1.5% of patients. Most cases with adenovirus, influenza A, hMPV, hBoV, coronaviruses, and WU virus occurred as co‐infections while RSV, PIV‐3, and rhinovirus were identified most frequently as the only respiratory pathogen. Rhinovirus but not RSV or PIV‐3 was also frequently identified in healthy controls. A higher HIV sero‐prevalence was noticed in patients with co‐infections although co‐infections were not associated with more severe disease. RSV, hPMV, PIV‐3, and influenza viruses had defined seasons while rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus infections occurred year round in this temporal region of sub‐Saharan Africa. J. Med.

"In contrast with adults, children infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) develop milder clinical symptoms. Because of this, it is speculated that children vaccinated with various childhood vaccines might develop cross immunity against SARS-CoV. Antisera and T cells from mice immunised with various vaccines were used to determine whether they developed cross reactivity against SARS-CoV. The results showed no marked cross reactivity against SARS-CoV, which implies that the reduced symptoms among children infected by SARS-CoV may be caused by other factors.","pathology"
"Background: There has been an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. With the use of detailed epidemiological data from other countries, this article describes the possible reason for the SARS epidemic not appearing in Japan, and simulates the impact of different control strategies that can break the transmission cycle of SARS associated coronavirus. Method: Mathematical modelling is used for predicting the epidemiological outcome and simultaneously for evaluating the effect of interventions on SARS. The study estimates the initial attack size that would result in failed invasion. Three different interventions have been incorporated into the public health response policies; precautionary public health measures, isolation of infected people, and quarantine of exposed humans. Results: The maximum number of humans newly infected could be roughly estimated on the basis of the initial attack size, using simple formulas. It is seen that the introduction of only a few cases into certain communities would not lead easily to an epidemic. The possible trajectories of SARS epidemic depend on the levels of public health interventions as quarantine and precautionary public health measures greatly affected the transmissibility of the disease. It is shown that there exist threshold levels of interventions at which the SARS epidemic settles down. Conclusion: Initial attack size is one of the determinants of whether SARS can successfully invade the community or not. Two of the most effective policy procedures to prevent new infections would be to apply stringent precautionary measures and to impose quicker and more effective quarantine of the exposed populace.","public"
"The maturation of virus-specific immunoglobulin G avidity during severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus infection was examined. The avidity indices were low (mean ± SD, 30.8% ± 11.6%) among serum samples collected ⩽50 days after fever onset, intermediate (mean ± SD, 52.1% ± 14.1%) among samples collected between days 51 and 90, and high (mean ± SD, 78.1% ± 8.0%) among samples collected after day 90. Avidity indices of 40% and 55% could be considered as cutoff values for determination of recent (⩽50 days) and past (>65 days) infection, respectively. Measurement of antibody avidity can be used to differentiate primary infection from reexposure and to assess humoral responses to candidate vaccines","microbiology"
"This report demonstrates that a rapid decrease of peripheral T cell subsets is a unique characteristic in patients with SARS during acute infection, although total white blood cell counts, red blood cell counts, and platelet counts remain relatively normal. In recovering patients, a rapid and dramatic restoration of peripheral T cell subsets was seen in the periphery. Although the underlying mechanism of the acute decrease of peripheral T cell subsets observed in patients with SARS during the acute stage remains unknown, this clinical characteristic can facilitate an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of SARS.","microbiology"
"BackgroundThe clinical features and incidence of human coronavirus (HCoV) infections in chronically ill older adults need better definition MethodsHCoV infection was determined on the basis of a 4-fold increase in serum antibody and the detection of HCoV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Laboratory-documented influenza (LDI) was detected by serologic assay and culture. HCoV illnesses were compared with other acute respiratory illnesses identified by active surveillance, during the 1998–99 winter respiratory-virus season, of 2215 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were ⩾50 years old and who received influenza vaccines ResultsHCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were associated with 90 (14%) of 665 illnesses (HCoV-229E in 22, HCoV-OC43 in 67, and both in 1), LDI with 107 (16%) of 678 illnesses. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, myalgia was less likely with HCoV infection than with LDI (OR, 0.27 [95% confidence limit, 0.13–0.58]). A majority of these HCoV and LDI illnesses exhibited each of 11 symptoms and signs of acute respiratory illness. Spirometric results worsened most often with LDI, and many acute respiratory illnesses, regardless of etiology, were associated with hospitalization. A total of 8 illnesses were associated with HCoV-NL63, 1 with HCoV-HKU1 ConclusionsThe frequencies of HCoV and LDI illnesses were similar. HCoV illness was less severe than LDI illness, was accompanied by multiple respiratory and systemic symptoms, and was associated with hospitalization","microbiology"
"During the past years, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been increasingly identified as pathogens associated with more-severe respiratory tract infection (RTI). Diagnostic tests for HCoVs are not frequently used in the routine setting. It is likely that, as a result, the precise role that HCoVs play in RTIs is greatly underestimated. We describe a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of HCoV that can easily be implemented in the routine diagnostic setting. HCoV was detected in 28 (11%) of the 261 clinical specimens obtained from patients presenting with symptoms of RTI ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia. Only 1 (0.4%) of the 243 control specimens obtained from patients without symptoms of RTI showed the presence of HCoV. We conclude that HCoVs can be frequently detected in patients presenting with RTI. Real-time RT-PCR provides a tool for large-scale epidemiological studies to further clarify the role that coronavirus infection plays in RTI in humans.","microbiology"
"Molecular beacons are dual-labelled probes that are typically used in real-time PCR assays, but have also been conjugated with solid matrices for use in microarrays or biosensors. We have developed a fluid array system using microsphere-conjugated molecular beacons and the flow cytometer for the specific, multiplexed detection of unlabelled nucleic acids in solution. For this array system, molecular beacons were conjugated with microspheres using a biotin-streptavidin linkage. A bridged conjugation method using streptavidin increased the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing for further discrimination of target quantitation. Using beads of different sizes and molecular beacons in two fluorophore colours, synthetic nucleic acid control sequences were specifically detected for three respiratory pathogens, including the SARS coronavirus in proof-of-concept experiments. Considering that routine flow cytometers are able to detect up to four fluorescent channels, this novel assay may allow for the specific multiplex detection of a nucleic acid panel in a single tube.","biochemistry"

"A method for the parallel solid‐phase synthesis of peptide aldehydes has been developed. Protected amino acid aldehydes obtained by the racemization‐free oxidation of amino alcohols with Dess–Martin periodinane were immobilized on threonyl resins as oxazolidines. Following Boc protection of the ring nitrogen to yield the N‐protected oxazolidine linker, peptide synthesis was performed efficiently on this resin. A peptide aldehyde library was designed for targeting the SARS coronavirus main protease, SARS‐CoV Mpro(also known as 3CLpro), on the basis of three different reported binding modes and supported by virtual screening. A set of 25 peptide aldehydes was prepared by this method and investigated in inhibition assays against SARS‐CoV Mpro. Several potent inhibitors were found with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. An IC50 of 7.5 μM was found for AcNSTSQ‐H and AcESTLQ‐H. Interestingly, the most potent inhibitors seem to bind to SARS‐CoV Mpro in a noncanonical binding mode.","chemistry"
"Activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a major contributor to the off-target effects of RNA interference in mammalian cells. While IFN induction complicates gene function studies, immunostimulation by siRNAs may be beneficial in certain therapeutic settings. Various forms of siRNA, meeting different compositional and structural requirements, have been reported to trigger IFN activation. The consensus is that intracellularly expressed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are less prone to IFN activation because they are not detected by the cell-surface receptors. In particular, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs has been reported to avoid IFN response. Here we identify a shRNA that potently activates the IFN pathway in human cells in a sequence- and 5′-triphosphate-dependent manner. In addition to suppressing its intended mRNA target, expression of the shRNA results in dimerization of interferon regulatory factor-3, activation of IFN promoters and secretion of biologically active IFNs into the extracellular medium. Delivery by lentiviral vector transduction did not avoid IFN activation by this and another, unrelated shRNA. We also demonstrated that retinoic-acid-inducible gene I, and not melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 or toll-like receptor 3, is the cytoplasmic sensor for intracellularly expressed shRNAs that trigger IFN activation.","biochemistry"

"Background. The newly emerged influenza A(H1N1) virus (new H1N1 virus) is causing the first influenza pandemic of this century. Three influenza pandemics of the previous century caused variable mortality, which largely depended on the development of severe pneumonia. However, the ability of the new H1N1 virus to cause pneumonia is poorly understood. Methods. The new H1N1 virus was inoculated intratracheally into ferrets. Its ability to cause pneumonia was compared with that of seasonal influenza H1N1 virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus by using clinical, virological, and pathological analyses. Results. Our results showed that the new H1N1 virus causes pneumonia in ferrets intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal H1N1 virus and by HPAI H5N1 virus. The new H1N1 virus replicated well throughout the lower respiratory tract and more extensively than did both seasonal H1N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the bronchi) and HPAI H5N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the alveoli). High loads of new H1N1 virus in lung tissue were associated with diffuse alveolar damage and mortality. Conclusions. The new H1N1 virus may be intrinsically more pathogenic for humans than is seasonal H1N1 virus.","microbiology"
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope spike (S) glycoprotein, a Class I viral fusion protein, is responsible for the fusion between the membranes of the virus and the target cell. In order to gain new insight into the protein membrane alteration leading to the viral fusion mechanism, a peptide pertaining to the putative pre-transmembrane domain (PTM) of the S glycoprotein has been studied by infrared and fluorescence spectroscopies regarding its structure, its ability to induce membrane leakage, aggregation, and fusion, as well as its affinity toward specific phospholipids. We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV PTM peptide binds to and interacts with phospholipid model membranes, and, at the same time, it adopts different conformations when bound to membranes of different compositions. As it has been already suggested for other viral fusion proteins such as HIV gp41, the region of the SARS-CoV protein where the PTM peptide resides could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes working synergistically with other membrane-active regions of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein to heighten the fusion process and therefore might be essential for the assistance and enhancement of the viral and cell fusion process.","chemistry"
"A new SARS animal model was established by inoculating SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) into rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) through the nasal cavity. Pathological pulmonary changes were successively detected on days 5–60 after virus inoculation. All eight animals showed a transient fever 2–3 days after inoculation. Immunological, molecular biological, and pathological studies support the establishment of this SARS animal model. Firstly, SARS‐CoV‐specific IgGs were detected in the sera of macaques from 11 to 60 days after inoculation. Secondly, SARS‐CoV RNA could be detected in pharyngeal swab samples using nested RT‐PCR in all infected animals from 5 days after virus inoculation. Finally, histopathological changes of interstitial pneumonia were found in the lungs during the 60 days after viral inoculation: these changes were less marked at later time points, indicating that an active healing process together with resolution of an acute inflammatory response was taking place in these animals. This animal model should provide insight into the mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐related pulmonary disease and greatly facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS.

"Taiwan was affected by an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in early 2003. A questionnaire survey was conducted to determine (1) the perceptions of risk of SARS infection in nurses; (2) the proportion of nurses considering leaving their job; and (3) work as well as non-work factors related to nurses' consideration of leaving their job because of the SARS outbreak. Nearly three quarters (71.9%) of the participants believed they were 'at great risk of exposure to SARS', 49.9% felt'an increase in workload', and 32.4% thought that people avoided them because of their job; 7.6% of the nurses not only considered that they should not care for SARS patients but were looking for another job or considering resignation. The main predictors of nurses' consideration of leaving their job were shorter tenure, increased work stress, perceived risk of fatality from SARS, and affected social relationships. The findings are important in view of potential impending threats of pandemics such as avian influenza.","nursing"
"Mapping the epitope of an antibody is of great interest, since it contributes much to our understanding of the mechanisms of molecular recognition and provides the basis for rational vaccine design. Here we present Mapitope, a computer algorithm for epitope mapping. The algorithm input is a set of affinity isolated peptides obtained by screening phage display peptide‐libraries with the antibody of interest. The output is usually 1–3 epitope candidates on the surface of the atomic structure of the antigen. We have systematically tested the performance of Mapitope by assessing the effect of the algorithm parameters on the final prediction. Thus, we have examined the effect of the statistical threshold (ST) parameter, relating to the frequency distribution and enrichment of amino acid pairs from the isolated peptides and the D (distance) and E (exposure) parameters which relate to the physical parameters of the antigen. Two model systems were analyzed in which the antibody of interest had previously been co‐crystallized with the antigen and thus the epitope is a given. The Mapitope algorithm successfully predicted the epitopes in both models. Accordingly, we formulated a stepwise paradigm for the prediction of discontinuous conformational epitopes using peptides obtained from screening phage display libraries. We applied this paradigm to successfully predict the epitope of the Trastuzumab antibody on the surface of the Her‐2/neu receptor in a third model system.

"Background and objective:  The aim of this study was to investigate the aerobic capacity of children 3 years after they were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods:  Twenty‐seven patients who completed both pulmonary function and maximal aerobic capacity tests at 6 and 15 months after the acute illness were invited to return for reassessment. Results:  Twenty‐one patients (median age 18.2 years, interquartile range (IQR) 16.5–19.7) completed all investigations at 36 months. Pulmonary function was normal in all patients. Maximal aerobic capacity, peak oxygen pulse (peak VO2) and ventilatory anaerobic threshold showed significant improvements compared with values measured at 6 months in both boys and girls. In girls, ventilatory efficiency (ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide) and perfusion of the lungs (end‐tidal partial carbon dioxide pressure) had not increased further compared with the values measured at 15 months. Although peak VO2 improved further at 36 months in patients with or without persistent radiological abnormalities, the values were 68% (IQR 50–84) and 74% (IQR 60–99), respectively, of those for normal control subjects.

Using the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope protein (SCVme), and core streptavidin (cSA) of Streptomyces avidinii as model proteins, specific immobilization of the GBP-fusion proteins onto the gold nanoparticles and generation of protein nanopatterns on the bare gold surface were demonstrated. The GBP-fused SCVme bound to gold nanoparticles successfully interacted with its antibody and showed changes in absorbance and color, allowing efficient diagnosis of SARS-CoV. The fusion proteins could be successfully immobilized on the gold surface by nanopatterning and microcontact printing as examined by atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance analysis. The poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic channels were created on the gold surface and were used for antigen−antibody and DNA−DNA interaction studies. Specific immobilization of GBP−EGFP fusion protein and its interaction with the antibody in the microchannels could be demonstrated. By immobilizing the DNA probe through the use of GBP-fused cSA, specific hybridization of the target DNA prepared from Salmonella could also be achieved. The GBP-fusion method allows immobilization of proteins onto the gold surface without surface modification and in bioactive forms suitable for studying protein−protein, DNA−DNA, and other biomolecular interaction studies. Furthermore, these studies can be carried out in a microfluidic system, which allows high-throughput analysis of biomolecular interactions.","chemistry"
"An integrated system has been developed for discovering potent inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV 3CLpro) by virtual screening correlating with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technologies-based assays. The authors screened 81,287 small molecular compounds against SPECS database by virtual screening; 256 compounds were subsequently selected for biological evaluation. Through SPR technology-based assay, 52 from these 256 compounds were discovered to show binding to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The enzymatic inhibition activities of these 52 SARS-CoV 3CLpro binders were further applied to FRET-based assay, and IC50 values were determined. Based on this integrated assay platform, 8 new SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors were discovered. The fact that the obtained IC50 values for the inhibitors are in good accordance with the discovered dissociation equilibrium constants (KDs) assayed by SPR implied the reliability of this platform. Our current work is hoped to supply a powerful approach in the discovery of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, and the determined inhibitors could be used as possible lead compounds for further research.","chemistry"
"Human activities have resulted in substantial, large‐scale environmental modifications, especially in the past century. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly coming to realize that parasites and pathogens, like free‐living organisms, evolve as the consequence of these anthropogenic changes. Although this area now commands the attention of a variety of researchers, a broad predictive framework is lacking, mainly because the links between human activities, the environment and parasite evolution are complex. From empirical and theoretical examples chosen in the literature, we give an overview of the ways in which humans can directly or indirectly influence the evolution of different traits in parasites (e.g. specificity, virulence, polymorphism). We discuss the role of direct and indirect factors as diverse as habitat fragmentation, pollution, biodiversity loss, climate change, introduction of species, use of vaccines and antibiotics, ageing of the population, etc. We also present challenging questions for further research. Understanding the links between anthropogenic changes and parasite evolution needs to become a cornerstone of public health planning, economic development and conservation biology.","evolutionary"
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3C-like protease (3CLpro or Mpro) is an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS drugs because of its crucial role in the viral life cycle. In this study, a compound database was screened by the structure-based virtual screening approach to identify initial hits as inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Out of the 59 363 compounds docked, 93 were selected for the inhibition assay, and 21 showed inhibition against SARS-CoV 3CLpro (IC50 ≤ 30 μM), with three of them having common substructures. Furthermore, a search for analogues with common substructure in the Maybridge, ChemBridge, and SPECS_SC databases led to the identification of another 25 compounds that exhibited inhibition against SARS-CoV 3CLpro (IC50 = 3−1000 μM). These compounds, 28 in total, were subjected to 3D-QSAR studies to elucidate the pharmacophore of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.","chemistry"
"Although viral replication and overwhelming immune responses are believed to contribute to the progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), little is known about the temporal relationship between viral load, ribavirin, proinflammatory cytokines, and clinical progression. We report that ribavirin was not effective in reducing the SARS coronavirus load in 3 of 8 probable cases studied and that elevated levels of interleukin (IL)—6 and IL-8 subsequent to the peak viral load were found in 8 and 6 cases, respectively. The nadir lymphocyte count during lymphopenia, the peak level of lactate dehydrogenase, and the peak density of pulmonary infiltrates lag further behind the peak viral load by a median of 4, 5, and 3.5 days, respectively. These findings provide important information for therapeutic strategies to treat SARS.","microbiology"

Pathogens for which there is more-compelling evidence of survival in environmental reservoirs include Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and pathogens for which there is evidence of probable survival in environmental reservoirs include norovirus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome—associated coronavirus, and Candida species. Strategies to reduce the rates of nosocomial infection with these pathogens should conform to established guidelines, with an emphasis on thorough environmental cleaning and use of Environmental Protection Agency—approved detergent-disinfectants.","microbiology"
"We observed that a number of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) developed affective psychosis during the acute phase of their illness. We reviewed all SARS-related psychiatric consultations in Hong Kong and investigated the risk factors for psychosis among patients with SARS in a matched case-control study. Patients with SARS-related psychosis received higher total doses of steroids and had higher rates of family history of psychiatric illness. The findings of the present study suggest that steroid toxicity, personal vulnerability, and, probably, psychosocial stressors jointly contributed to the development of psychosis in patients with SARS.","microbiology"
"Docking and pharmacophore screening tools were used to examine the binding of ligands in the active site of thymidine monophosphate kinase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Docking analysis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) analogues suggests the role of hydrogen bonding and other weak interactions in enzyme selectivity. Water-mediated hydrogen-bond networks and a halogen-bond interaction seem to stabilize the molecular recognition. A pharmacophore model was developed using 20 dTMP analogues. The pharmacophoric features were complementary to the active site residues involved in the ligand recognition. On the basis of these studies, a composite screening model that combines the features from both the docking analysis and the pharmacophore model was developed. The composite model was validated by screening a database spiked with 47 known inhibitors. The model picked up 42 of these, giving an enrichment factor of 17. The validated model was used to successfully screen an in-house database of about 500 000 compounds. Subsequent screening with other filters gave 186 hit molecules.","computer"
"cl‐2 virus is an extremely neurovirulent murine coronavirus. However, during the initial phase of infection between 12 and 24 h post‐inoculation (hpi), the viral antigens are detected only in the meninges, followed by viral spread into the ventricular wall before invasion into the brain parenchyma, indicating that the viruses employ a passage between the meninges and ventricular wall as an entry route into the brain parenchyma. At 48 hpi, the passage was found to be constructed by ER‐TR7 antigen (ERag)‐positive fibers (ERfibs) associated with laminin and collagen III between the fourth ventricle and meninges at the cerebellopontine angle. The construct of the fibers mimics the reticular fibers of the fibroblastic reticular network, which comprises a conduit system in the lymphoid organs. In the meninges, ERfibs together with collagen fibers, lining in a striped pattern, made up a pile of thin sheets. In the brain parenchyma, mature ERfibs associated with laminin were found around blood vessels. Besides mature ERfibs, immature Erfibs without associations with other extracellular matrix components like laminin and collagen appeared after infection, suggesting that the CNS creates a unique conduit system for immune communication triggered by viral invasion.","pathology"
"Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is an emerging virus associated clinically and epidemiologically with fever, depression, anorexia and less frequently colic and diarrhoea in adult horses. Sporadic cases and outbreaks have been reported with increased frequency since 2010 from Japan, the USA and more recently from Europe. A faeco‐oral transmission route is suspected and clinical or asymptomatic infected horses appear to be responsible for direct and indirect transmission of ECoV. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of ECoV infection may be suggested by clinical presentation, haematological abnormalities such as leucopenia due to lymphopenia and/or neutropenia. Confirmation of ECoV infection is provided by specific ECoV nucleic acid detection in faeces by quantitative PCR (qPCR) or demonstration of coronavirus antigen by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy in intestinal biopsy material obtained ante or post mortem. The disease is generally self‐limiting and horses typically recover with symptomatic supportive care. Complications associated with disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier have been reported in some infected horses and include endotoxaemia, septicaemia and hyperammonaemia‐associated encephalopathy. Although specific immunoprophylactic measures have been shown to be effective in disease prevention for closely‐related coronaviruses such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV), such strategies have yet not been investigated for horses and disease prevention is limited to basic biosecurity protocols. This article reviews current knowledge concerning the aetiology, epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, pathology, treatment and prevention of ECoV infection in adult horses.","veterinary"
"The metallopeptidase Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is an important drug target for the treatment of hypertension, heart, kidney, and lung disease. Recently, a close and unique human ACE homologue termed ACE2 has been identified and found to be an interesting new cardiorenal disease target. With the recently resolved inhibitor-bound ACE2 crystal structure available, we have attempted a structure-based approach to identify novel potent and selective inhibitors. Computational approaches focus on pharmacophore-based virtual screening of large compound databases. Selectivity was ensured by initial screening for ACE inhibitors within an internal database and the Derwent World Drug Index, which could be reduced to zero false positives and 0.1% hit rate, respectively. An average hit reduction of 0.44% was achieved with a five feature hypothesis, searching ∼3.8 million compounds from various commercial databases. Seventeen compounds were selected based on high fit values as well as diverse structure and subjected to experimental validation in a bioassay. We show that all compounds displayed an inhibitory effect on ACE2 activity, the six most promising candidates exhibiting IC50 values in the range of 62−179 μM.","computer"
"A new class of potential prodrugs, 1,3‐cyclic propanyl phosphate esters of 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid, was designed and synthesized through the key reaction of 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid with 1,3‐cyclic propanyl phosphate ester catalysed by lithium diisopropylamide. The sustained‐release properties of 1,3‐cyclic propanyl phosphate esters of 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid in vivo were also investigated. The animal experiments showed that 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid was released from 1,3‐cyclic propanyl phosphate esters of 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid at a steady rate in rats and the plasma concentrations of 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid were nearly stable. The result indicated that 1,3‐cyclic propanyl phosphate esters of 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid have sustained‐release properties to avoid the quick metabolism of 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid. These prodrugs are highlighted as a promising new strategy to improve 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid metabolism.","chemistry"

The most potent inhibitor is an anilide derived from 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, l-phenylalanine and 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid. This anilide is a competitive inhibitor of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki = 0.03 μM. The molecular docking experiment indicates that the P1 residue of this anilide inhibitor is distant from the nucleophilic SH of Cys145 in the active site.","chemistry"
"Background. Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a recently discovered human coronavirus found to cause respiratory illness in children and adults that is distinct from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV-229E) and OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Methods. We investigated the role that HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E played in children hospitalized with fever and acute respiratory symptoms in Hong Kong during the period from August 2001 through August 2002. Results. Coronavirus infections were detected in 26 (4.4%) of 587 children studied; 15 (2.6%) were positive for HCoV-NL63, 9 (1.5%) were positive for HCoV-OC43, and 2 (0.3%) were positive for HCoV-229E. In addition to causing upper respiratory disease, we found that HCoV-NL63 can present as croup, asthma exacerbation, febrile seizures, and high fever. The mean age (± standard deviation [SD]) of the infected children was 30.7 ± 19.8 months (range, 6–57 months). The mean maximum temperature (±SD) for the 12 children who were febrile was 39.3°C ± 0.9°C, and the mean total duration of fever (±SD) for all children was 2.6 ± 1.2 days (range, 1–5 days). HCoV-NL63 infections were noted in the spring and summer months of 2002, whereas HCoV-OC43 infection mainly occurred in the fall and winter months of 2001. HCoV-NL63 viruses appeared to cluster into 2 evolutionary lineages, and viruses from both lineages cocirculated in the same season. Conclusions. HCoV-NL63 is a significant pathogen that contributes to the hospitalization of children, and it was estimated to have caused 224 hospital admissions per 100,000 population aged ⩽6 years each year in Hong Kong.","microbiology"
"Many epidemiologists have agreed that a refined estimate of the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) would need a sample size of about 200 cases and appropriate statistical methods enabling the inclusion of cases with defined periods of exposure. However, no such studies have been reported so far. Besides, determinants of the SARS incubation period remain unclear. In this study, 209 probable SARS cases with documented episodes of exposure between March 1 and May 31, 2003, in mainland China were included. A nonparametric method was used to analyze these data with defined periods of exposure to obtain the refined estimate of the SARS incubation period. Furthermore, the authors also explored the influence of various factors on the SARS incubation period by analysis of variance, linear regression analysis, and analysis of covariance. The estimates of mean and variance of the SARS incubation period were 5.29 days and 12.33 days2, respectively; 90% of patients would have an incubation period of less than 11.58 days with a probability of 0.8, and 99% of patients would have an incubation of less than 22.22 days with a probability of 0.9. The affected area showed a highly significant effect on the incubation period (p < 0.001), but the contact pattern, occupation, gender, and age did not.","public"
"BackgroundRecently, we described the discovery of a novel group 2 coronavirus, coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1), from a patient with pneumonia. However, the clinical and molecular epidemiological features of CoV-HKU1–associated pneumonia are unknown MethodsProspectively collected (during a 12-month period) nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from patients with community-acquired pneumonia from 4 hospitals were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, for detection of CoV-HKU1. The epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of patients with CoV-HKU1–associated pneumonia were analyzed. The pol spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes were also sequenced ResultsNPAs from 10 (2.4%) of 418 patients with community-acquired pneumonia were found to be positive for CoV-HKU1. All 10 cases occurred in spring and winter. Nine of these patients were adults, and 4 had underlying diseases of the respiratory tract. In the 6 patients from whom serum samples were available, all had a 4-fold change in immunoglobulin (Ig) G titer and/or presence of IgM against CoV-HKU1. The 2 patients who died had significantly lower hemoglobin levels, monocyte counts, albumin levels, and oxygen saturation levels on admission and had more-extensive involvement visible on chest radiographs. Sequence analysis of the pol S, and N genes revealed 2 genotypes of CoV-HKU1 ConclusionsCoV-HKU1 accounts for 2.4% of community-acquired pneumonia, with 2 genotypes in the study population.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has emerged as a highly contagious, sometimes fatal disease. To find disease-specific B cell epitopes, phage-displayed random peptide libraries were panned on serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies from patients with SARS. Forty-nine immunopositive phage clones that bound specifically to serum from patients with SARS were selected. These phageborne peptides had 4 consensus motifs, of which 2 corresponded to amino acid sequences reported for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV). Synthetic peptide binding and competitive-inhibition assays further confirmed that patients with SARS generated antibodies against SARS-CoV. Immunopositive phage clones and epitope-based peptide antigens demonstrated clinical diagnostic potential by reacting with serum from patients with SARS. Antibody-response kinetics were evaluated in 4 patients with SARS, and production of IgM, IgG, and IgA were documented as part of the immune response. In conclusion, B cell epitopes of SARS corresponded to novel coronavirus. Our epitope-based serologic test may be useful in laboratory detection of the virus and in further study of the pathogenesis of SARS.","microbiology"

"Bicistronic reporter assay systems have become a mainstay of molecular biology. While the assays themselves encompass a broad range of diverse and unrelated experimental protocols, the numerical data garnered from these experiments often have similar statistical properties. In general, a primary dataset measures the paired expression of two internally controlled reporter genes. The expression ratio of these two genes is then normalized to an external control reporter. The end result is a ‘ratio of ratios’ that is inherently sensitive to propagation of the error contributed by each of the respective numerical components. The statistical analysis of this data therefore requires careful handling in order to control for the propagation of error and its potentially misleading effects. A careful survey of the literature found no consistent method for the statistical analysis of data generated from these important and informative assay systems. In this report, we present a detailed statistical framework for the systematic analysis of data obtained from bicistronic reporter assay systems. Specifically, a dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to measure the efficiency of four programmed −1 frameshift signals. These frameshift signals originate from the L-A virus, the SARS-associated Coronavirus and computationally identified frameshift signals from two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. Furthermore, these statistical methods were applied to prove that the effects of anisomycin on programmed −1 frameshifting are statistically significant. A set of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, which can be used as templates for data generated by dual reporter assay systems, and an online tutorial are available at our website (http://dinmanlab.umd.edu/statistics). These spreadsheets could be easily adapted to any bicistronic reporter assay system.","biochemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in 30 countries and regions, with a cumulative total of 8,099 probable cases and 774 deaths as of July 31, 2003, according to the World Health Organization. In Hong Kong, People’s Republic of China, 1,755 SARS cases and 299 deaths had occurred as of September 22, 2003. The authors analyzed data from the Department of Health, Hong Kong SAR. The data series includes details regarding sex, age, and chronic disease history. Using data from early March to September 22, 2003, the authors found that males had a significantly (p < 0.0001) higher case fatality rate than females did, 21.9% versus 13.2%; the relative risk was 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35, 2.05), and it was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.16) after adjustment for age. Subgroup analysis was conducted by excluding health care workers (n = 386) from the analysis. The overall crude relative risk of mortality was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.74), and the adjusted relative risk was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.00). Thus, among SARS patients, males may be more severely affected by the disease than females are. This finding could be related to a nonuniform case definition of SARS disease, a different treatment regimen, a past smoking history, work-environment factors, or gender-specific immune-defense factors, for instance.","public"
"Composition Vector Tree (CVTree) implements a systematic method of inferring evolutionary relatedness of microbial organisms from the oligopeptide content of their complete proteomes (http://cvtree.cbi.pku.edu.cn). Since the first bacterial genomes were sequenced in 1995 there have been several attempts to infer prokaryote phylogeny from complete genomes. Most of them depend on sequence alignment directly or indirectly and, in some cases, need fine-tuning and adjustment. The composition vector method circumvents the ambiguity of choosing the genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and avoids the necessity of aligning sequences of essentially different length and gene content. This new method does not contain ‘free’ parameter and ‘fine-tuning’. A bootstrap test for a phylogenetic tree of 139 organisms has shown the stability of the branchings, which support the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) tree of life in its overall structure and in many details. It may provide a quick reference in prokaryote phylogenetics whenever the proteome of an organism is available, a situation that will become commonplace in the near future.","biochemistry"

"Background: The association between weather and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) transmission in Beijing and Hong Kong in the 2003 epidemic was studied to examine the effect of weather on SARS transmission. Methods: Pearson’s correlation analyses and negative binomial regression analyses were used to quantify the correlations between the daily newly reported number of SARS cases and weather variables, using daily disease notification data and meteorological data from the two locations. Results: The results indicate that there were inverse association between the number of daily cases and maximum and/or minimum temperatures whereas air pressure was found to be positively associated with SARS transmission. Conclusion: The study suggests that weather might be a contributory factor in the 2003 SARS epidemic, in particular in the transmission among the community members.","medicine"
"In today's world of high-throughput in silico screening, the development of virtual screening methodologies to prioritize small molecules as new chemical entities (NCEs) for synthesis is of current interest. Among several approaches to virtual screening, structure-based virtual screening has been considered the most effective. However the problems associated with the ranking of potential solutions in terms of scoring functions remains one of the major bottlenecks in structure-based virtual screening technology. It has been suggested that scoring functions may be used as filters for distinguishing binders from nonbinders instead of accurately predicting their binding free energies. Subsequently, several improvements have been made in this area, which include the use of multiple rather than single scoring functions and application of either consensus or multivariate statistical methods or both to improve the discrimination between binders and nonbinders. In view of it, the discriminative ability (distinguishing binders from nonbinders) of binary QSAR models derived using LUDI and MOE scoring functions has been compared with the models derived by Jacobbsson et al. on five data sets viz. estrogen receptor αmimics (ERα_mimics), estrogen receptor αtoxins (ERα_toxins), matrix metalloprotease 3 inhibitors (MMP-3), factor Xa inhibitors (fXa), and acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AChE). The overall analyses reveal that binary QSAR is comparable to the PLS discriminant analysis, rule-based, and Bayesian classification methods used by Jacobsson et al. Further the scoring functions implemented in LUDI and MOE can score a wide range of protein−ligand interactions and are comparable to the scoring functions implemented in ICM and Cscore. Thus the binary QSAR models derived using LUDI and MOE scoring functions may be useful as a preliminary screening layer in a multilayered virtual screening paradigm.","computer"
"The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is one of the major virion structural proteins of a newly identified coronavirus, which has been confirmed as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The major function of N protein is to assemble the RNA of coronavirus. In the present study, the gene encoding the N protein was cloned and the protein was expressed, purified, and refolded as shown by 1H NMR measurement. The maximal Trp emission wavelength occurs near 331 nm, suggesting substantial burial of Trp residues. Circular dichroism measurements indicate that N protein contains little α-helical structure. Acid titration shows that N protein begins to unfold near pH 5 and is fully denatured near pH 2.7, and the acid unfolding process is reversible. The physical and chemical properties of N protein indicate that its stability is low. N protein is denatured reversibly at pH 7.4 either by urea (with Cm of 2.77 M and m value of 2.74 kcal mol-1 M-1) or GdmCl (with Cm of 1.46 M and m value of 4.50 kcal mol-1 M-1). In the heat-induced denaturation in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, N-protein starts to unfold at 35 °C and is completely denatured at 55 °C, where SARS virus was also reported to be inactivated. We propose that the low stability of N protein may be critical for the stability and function of SARS virus.","biochemistry"
"We present the first proteomic analysis on the cellular responses to avian influenza virus (H9N2) infection in a human cell line in different time courses in order to search for target proteins for viral pathogenesis/adaptation studies. By using 2‐DE coupled with MALDI‐TOF MS and nano‐ESI‐MS/MS, we identified a set of differentially expressed cellular proteins, including cytoplasmic actin, cytokeratin, prohibitin, enoyl‐CoA hydratase, peptide‐prolyl cis–trans isomerase A (PPIase A), chloride intracellular channel protein 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, guanine nucleotide‐binding protein subunit beta, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, elongation factor 1‐beta and splicing factor, arginine/serine rich 1. The most significant changes in different time courses were found in cytoplasmic actin and cytokeratin, both of which constituted the major components of cytoskeleton network in the cells.

"Virtual ligand screening methods based on the structure of the receptor are extensively used to facilitate the discovery of lead compounds. In the present study, we investigated the LigandFit package on four different proteins (coagulation factor VIIa, estrogen receptor, thymidine kinase, and neuraminidase), a relatively large compound collection of 65,560 unique “drug‐like” molecules and four focused libraries (1950 molecules each). We performed virtual screening experiments with the large database and evaluated six scoring functions available in the package (DockScore, LigScore1, LigScore2, PLP1, PLP2, and PMF). The results showed that LigandFit is an efficient program, especially when used with LigScore1. Similar computations were carried out using focused libraries. In this situation the LigScore1 scoring function outperformed the other ones on three out of the four proteins tested. Even for the difficult neuraminidase case, the LigandFit/LigScore1 combination was still reasonably successful. Assessment of docking accuracy was also performed and again, we found that LigandFit (with DockScore and the CFF parameters) was performing well. On the basis of these results and observed increased enrichments after LigandFit/Ligscore1 screening on focused libraries, we suggest that using this program as a final step of a hierarchical protocol can be very beneficial to assist lead finding.

"The development of a new recombinant factor VIII was designed and implemented to answer a number of unmet needs of patients affected by hemophilia A. Turoctocog alfa is bioengineered in a specific Chinese hamster ovary clone to present translational and posttranslational characteristics (sulphation, glycosylation) biosimilar to natural circulating forms of FVIII, with the aim to devoid any minimal change which may impact immunogenicity and antigenicity of recombinant protein. Both producer cell line and media are maintained free of any animal or human plasma derivative. Downstream processes of purification are performed by five steps (immunoaffinity chromatography, ion‐exchange chromatography, virus inactivation by means of solvent‐detergent treatment and nanofiltration, and to end with gel filtration), to provide the best possible margin of safety from known and unknown infectious agents. Large clinical trials seem to confirm the expectations placed in Turoctocog alfa in terms of high quality and safety of recombinant FVIII toward the goal of overcoming actual and future challenges of hemophilia therapy.","hematology"
"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has recently been identified as a causative agent of acute respiratory tract illnesses in infants and young children. The HCoV-NL63 spike (S) protein mediates virion attachment to cells and subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. This viral entry process is a primary target for vaccine and drug development. HCoV-NL63 S is expressed as a single-chain glycoprotein and consists of an N-terminal receptor-binding domain (S1) and a C-terminal transmembrane fusion domain (S2). The latter contains two highly conserved heptad-repeat (HR) sequences that are each extended by 14 amino acids relative to those of the SARS coronavirus or the prototypic murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus. Limited proteolysis studies of the HCoV-NL63 S2 fusion core identify an α-helical domain composed of a trimer of the HR segments N57 and C42. The crystal structure of this complex reveals three C42 helices entwined in an oblique and antiparallel manner around a central triple-stranded coiled coil formed by three N57 helices. The overall geometry comprises distinctive high-affinity conformations of interacting cross-sectional layers of the six helices. As a result, this structure is unusually stable, with an apparent melting temperature of 78 °C in the presence of the denaturant guanidine hydrochloride at 5 M concentration. The extended HR regions may therefore be required to prime the group 1 S glycoproteins for their fusion-activating conformational changes during viral entry. Our results provide an initial basis for understanding an intriguing interplay between the presence or absence of proteolytic maturation among the coronavirus groups and the membrane fusion activity of their S glycoproteins. This study also suggests a potential strategy for the development of improved HCoV-NL63 fusion inhibitors.","biochemistry"
"Llamas possess a class of unconventional immunoglobulins that have only heavy chains; unpaired heavy variable domains are responsible for antigen binding. These domains have previously been cloned and expressed as single domain antibodies (sdAbs); they comprise the smallest known antigen binding fragments. SdAbs have been shown to bind antigens at >90 °C and to refold after being denatured. To take advantage of the remarkable properties of sdAbs, we constructed a large, semisynthetic llama sdAb library. This library facilitated the rapid selection of binders to an array of biothreat targets. We selected sdAb specific for live vaccinia virus (a smallpox virus surrogate), hen egg lysozyme, cholera toxin, ricin, and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. The selected sdAb possessed high specificity as well as enhanced thermal stability in comparison to conventional IgG and scFv antibodies. We also determined equilibrium dissociation constants as well as demonstrated the use of several antitoxin sdAbs as effective capture and reporter molecules in sandwich assays on the Luminex instrument. The ability to rapidly select such rugged antibodies will enhance the reliability of immunoassays by extending shelf life and the capacity to function in hostile environments.","chemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic emergent virus which replicates in cells that can express ABH histo-blood group antigens. The heavily glycosylated SARS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which serves as a cellular receptor. Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. In this study, we used a cellular model of adhesion to investigate whether natural antibodies of the ABO system could block the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. To this aim, a C-terminally EGFP-tagged S protein was expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with an α1,2-fucosyltransferase and an A-transferase in order to coexpress the S glycoprotein ectodomain and the A antigen at the cell surface. We observed that the S protein/angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-dependent adhesion of these cells to an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressing cell line was specifically inhibited by either a monoclonal or human natural anti-A antibodies, indicating that these antibodies may block the interaction between the virus and its receptor, thereby providing protection. In order to more fully appreciate the potential effect of the ABO polymorphism on the epidemiology of SARS, we built a mathematical model of the virus transmission dynamics that takes into account the protective effect of ABO natural antibodies. The model indicated that the ABO polymorphism could contribute to substantially reduce the virus transmission, affecting both the number of infected individuals and the kinetics of the epidemic.","biochemistry"
"An effective Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) vaccine is likely to include components that can induce specific cytotoxic T‐lymphocyte (CTL) responses. The specificities of such responses are governed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐restricted presentation of SARS‐derived peptide epitopes. Exact knowledge of how the immune system handles protein antigens would allow for the identification of such linear sequences directly from genomic/proteomic sequence information (Lauemoller et al., Rev Immunogenet 2001: 2: 477–91). The latter was recently established when a causative coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) was isolated and full‐length sequenced (Marra et al., Science 2003: 300: 1399–404). Here, we have combined advanced bioinformatics and high‐throughput immunology to perform an HLA supertype‐, genome‐wide scan for SARS‐specific CTL epitopes. The scan includes all nine human HLA supertypes in total covering >99% of all individuals of all major human populations (Sette & Sidney, Immunogenetics 1999: 50: 201–12). For each HLA supertype, we have selected the 15 top candidates for test in biochemical binding assays. At this time (approximately 6 months after the genome was established), we have tested the majority of the HLA supertypes and identified almost 100 potential vaccine candidates. These should be further validated in SARS survivors and used for vaccine formulation. We suggest that immunobioinformatics may become a fast and valuable tool in rational vaccine design.","pathology"
"A new human coronavirus, HCoV‐NL63, was associated recently with bronchiolitis. The current study aimed to examine retrospectively stored specimens for the presence of HCoV‐NL63 using nested RT‐PCR assays targeting the 1a and 1b genes. The study population was composed of patients with acute respiratory disease warranting presentation to Queensland hospitals. HCoV‐NL63 was detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of 16 of 840 specimens representing 766 patients (2%). HCoV‐NL63 positive individuals were diagnosed most commonly with lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease (81%). The clinical diagnosis was commonly supported by an abnormal chest X‐ray (56%) together with respiratory distress (50%), wheeze (44%), and râles (25%) on first presentation with HCoV‐NL63 infection. All patients positive for HCoV‐NL63 required admission to hospital. Among 38% of HCoV‐NL63 positive specimens a second pathogen was detected. Sequencing of amplicon from gene 1b revealed more than 99% nucleotide homology with the viral type strains while sequencing amplicon from gene 1a permitted the grouping of viral strains. It was shown that HCoV‐NL63 is associated with severe LRT disease in an Australian hospital setting during the cooler months of the year. We propose that HCoV‐NL63 is a global and seasonal pathogen of both children and adults associated with severe LRT illness. J. Med. Virol. 75:455–462, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"Measurements of the number of copies of DNA or mRNA with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) have transformed the drug development process. This transformation is driven by the information these measurements have contributed for a better understanding of the molecular definition of disease and of the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity for new drugs. As this information is translated into accurate genomic biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity, drug development processes supported by these measurements are becoming more efficient. This transformation is exemplified in the conversion of P450 enzyme activity measurements to gene expression in drug metabolism studies, the measurement of cytokine and chemokine genomic expression levels as clinical markers, and the identification and evaluation of genomic biomarkers of nephrotoxicity. A good understanding of factors affecting qPCR measurements can simplify their implementation, as will high‐throughput platforms for these assays. Drug Dev.

"In an attempt to understand what distinguishes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV) from other members of the coronaviridae, we searched for elements that are unique to its proteins and not present in any other family member. We identified an insertion of two glycine residues, forming the GxxxG motif, in the SCoV spike protein transmembrane domain (TMD), which is not found in any other coronavirus. This surprising finding raises an “oligomerization riddle”:  the GxxxG motif is a known dimerization signal, while the SCoV spike protein is known to be trimeric. Using an in vivo assay, we found that the SCoV spike protein TMD is oligomeric and that this oligomerization is driven by the GxxxG motif. We also found that the GxxxG motif contributes toward the trimerization of the entire spike protein; in that, mutations in the GxxxG motif decrease trimerization of the full-length protein expressed in mammalian cells. Using molecular modeling, we show that the SCoV spike protein TMD adopts a distinct and unique structure as opposed to all other coronaviruses. In this unique structure, the glycine residues of the GxxxG motif are facing each other, enhancing helix−helix interactions by allowing for the close positioning of the helices. This unique orientation of the glycine residues also stabilizes the trimeric bundle during multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation in a hydrated lipid bilayer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the GxxxG motif can potentiate other oligomeric forms beside a dimer. Finally, according to recent studies, the stabilization of the trimeric bundle is linked to a higher fusion activity of the spike protein, and the possible influence of the GxxxG motif on this feature is discussed.","biochemistry"
"Serum titers of antibody to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen (VCA) have been positively correlated with malignancies of lymphoid proliferation, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. We have constructed a phage display combinatorial antibody Fab library from a patient with marginal zone B cell lymphoma associated with Sjögren's syndrome and carrying high serum anti-EBV-VCA IgG titer. Fab fragments were selected by panning against EBV-VCA protein coated onto ELISA plates, and selected Fab clones were characterized by ELISA, western blotting (WB), indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry. We have established two Fab clones, Fab-aVCA1 and Fab-aVCA21, which specifically recognize EBV-VCA by ELISA and WB. Inhibition ELISA competition showed that both clones could significantly reduce the binding of specific anti-EBV-VCA mAb to its relevant proteins. Furthermore, these two Fab clones could localize VCA protein in the EBV-positive P3HR1 and Daudi cell lines, as well as in tissue samples from patients with EBV-infected lymphoid malignancies. These results indicate that our two Fab clones are novel human mAbs specific for EBV-VCA protein and may have potential benefits for development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in EBV-related lymphoid malignancies.","immunology"
"The role of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus as an enteric pathogen was investigated in a cohort of 142 patients with SARS who were treated with a standard treatment protocol. Data from daily hematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations were prospectively collected, and the correlation of these findings with diarrhea was retrospectively analyzed. Sixty-nine patients (48.6%) developed diarrhea at a mean (± standard deviation [SD]) of 7.6 ± 2.6 days after the onset of symptoms. The diarrhea was most severe at a mean (±SD) of 8.8 ± 2.4 days after onset, with a maximum frequency of 24 episodes per day (median, 5 episodes; range, 3–24 episodes). A higher mean virus load in nasopharyngeal specimens obtained on day 10 after the onset of symptoms was significantly associated with the occurrence of diarrhea (3.1 log10 vs. 1.8 log10 copies/mL; P = .01) and mortality (6.2 vs. 1.7 log10 copies/mL; P < .01). However, diarrhea was not associated with mortality. The lung and the gastrointestinal tract may react differently to SARS coronavirus infection. Additional investigation of the role of SARS coronavirus in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in patients with SARS should be conducted.","microbiology"

"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is responsible for the outbreaks of hand‐foot‐and‐mouth disease in the Asia‐Pacific region. To produce the virus‐like particle (VLP) vaccine, we previously constructed recombinant baculoviruses to co‐express EV71 P1 polypeptide and 3CD protease using the Bac‐to‐Bac® vector system. The recombinant baculoviruses resulted in P1 cleavage by 3CD and subsequent VLP assembly in infected insect cells, but caused either low VLP yield or excessive VLP degradation. To tackle the problems, here we explored various expression cassette designs and flashBAC GOLD™ vector system which was deficient in v‐cath and chiA genes. We found that the recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD™ system was insufficient to improve the EV71 VLP yield. Nonetheless, BacF‐P1‐C3CD, a recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLDTM system to express P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the CMV promoter, dramatically improved the VLP yield while alleviating the VLP degradation. Infection of High FiveTM cells with BacF‐P1‐C3CD enhanced the total and extracellular VLP yield to ≈268 and ≈171 mg/L, respectively, which enabled the release of abundant VLP into the supernatant and simplified the downstream purification. Intramuscular immunization of mice with 5 μg purified VLP induced cross‐protective humoral responses and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge. Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (≈171 mg/L) and the potent immunogenicity conferred by 5 μg VLP, one liter High FiveTM culture produced ≈12,000 doses of purified vaccine, thus rendering the EV71 VLP vaccine economically viable and able to compete with inactivated virus vaccines.

"Background. The emergence and global spread of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus have raised questions regarding the protective effect of available seasonal vaccines and the efficacy of a newly produced matched vaccine. Methods. Ferrets were immunized with the 2008–2009 formulations of commercially available live attenuated (FluMist; MedImmune) or split-inactivated (Fluviral; GlaxoSmithKline) vaccines, a commercial swine vaccine (FluSure; Pfizer), or a laboratory-produced matched inactivated whole-virus vaccine (A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009). Adaptive immune responses were monitored, and the animals were challenged with A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009 after 5 weeks. Results. Only animals that received the swine or matched vaccines developed detectable hemagglutination- inhibiting antibodies against the challenge virus, whereas a T cell response was exclusively detected in animals vaccinated with FluMist. After challenge, all animals had high levels of virus replication in the upper respiratory tract. However, preexisting anti—pandemic H1N1 2009 antibodies resulted in reduced clinical signs and improved survival. Surprisingly, FluMist was associated with a slight increase in mortality and greater lung damage, which correlated with early up-regulation of interleukin-10. Conclusions. The present study demonstrates that a single dose of matched inactivated vaccine confers partial protection against a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, and it suggests that a higher dose or prime-boost regimen may be required. The consequences of mismatched immunity to influenza merit further investigation.","microbiology"
"Background. Few data exist on respiratory virus quantitation in lower respiratory samples and detection in serum from hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with respiratory virus-associated pneumonia. Methods. We retrospectively identified HCT recipients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus (MPV), and coronavirus (CoV) detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, and we tested stored BAL and/or serum samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results. In 85 BAL samples from 82 patients, median viral loads were as follows: for RSV (n=35), 2.6×106 copies/mL; for parainfluenza virus (n=35), 4.9×107 copies/mL; for influenza virus (n=9), 6.8×105 copies/mL; for MPV (n=7), 3.9×107 copies/mL; and for CoV (n=4), 1.8×105 copies/mL. Quantitative viral load was not associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Viral RNA was detected in serum samples from 6 of 66 patients: 4 of 41 with RSV pneumonia, 1 with influenza B, and 1 with MPV/influenza A virus/CoV coinfection (influenza A virus and MPV RNA detected). RSV detection in serum was associated with high viral load in BAL samples (P=.05), and viral RNA detection in serum was significantly associated with death (adjusted rate ratio, 1.8; P=.02). Conclusion. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction detects high viral loads in BAL samples from HCT recipients with respiratory virus pneumonia. Viral RNA is also detectable in the serum of patients with RSV, influenza, and MPV pneumonia and may correlate with the severity of disease.","microbiology"

"Recent intriguing findings from genetic linkage, knockout, and physiologic studies in mice and rats led us to conduct the first investigation of the novel angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2) in human hypertension (HT). We genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (A⇒G at nucleotide 1075 in intron 1, G⇒A at nucleotide 8790 in intron 3, C⇒G at nucleotide 28330 in intron 11, and G⇒C at nucleotide 36787 in intron 16) in HT (n = 152) and normotensive (NT, n = 193) groups having inherently high biological power (>80%) due to our inclusion only of subjects whose parents had the same BP status as themselves. The SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (D′ = 54% to 100%, P = .05 to 0.0001). Because ACE2 is on the X chromosome, data for each sex were analyzed separately. Minor allele frequencies in HT versus NT were as follows: for the intron 1 variant 0.21 versus 0.17 in female subjects (P = .31) and 0.25 versus 0.29 in male subjects (P = .60); intron 3 variant 0.22 versus 0.18 in female subjects (P = .35) and 0.15 versus 0.20 in male subjects (P = .47); intron 11 variant 0.39 versus 0.46 in male subjects (P = 0.17) and 0.31 versus 0.30 in male subjects (P = .96); intron 16 variant 0.20 versus 0.19 in female subjects (P = .72) and 0.17 versus 0.17 in male subjects (P = .95). Haplotype analysis was also negative. These data provide little support for ACE2 in genetic predisposition to HT.

"We evaluated the efficacy of three SARS vaccine candidates in a murine SARS model utilizing low‐virulence Pp and SARS‐CoV coinfection. Vaccinated mice were protected from severe respiratory disease in parallel with a low virus titer in the lungs and a high neutralizing antibody titer in the plasma. Importantly, the administration of spike protein‐specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody protected mice from the disease, indicating that the neutralization is sufficient for protection. Moreover, a high level of IL‐6 and MCP‐1 production, but not other 18 cytokines tested, on days 2 and 3 after SARS‐CoV infection was closely linked to the virus replication and disease severity, suggesting the importance of these cytokines in the lung pathogenicity of SARS‐CoV infection.","microbiology"
"Antisense oligonucleotides are recognized to be very efficient tools for the inhibition of gene expression in a sequence specific way. For the discovery of a novel efficient way to modify oligonucleotides, a series of single isonucleotide-incorporated antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been synthesized, in which an isonucleotide was introduced at different positions of the sequences. The binding behaviors of modified oligodeoxynucleotides to the complementary sequence were studied by UV, CD, and molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that although the incorporated isonucleotides at certain positions of the sequence interfere with the binding ability to a different extent, B-form duplexes were maintained and the binding abilities of the 3‘-end-modified duplexes were better than the corresponding mismatched duplexes. The digestion of modified oligodeoxynucleotides by snake venom phosphodiesterase showed that an isonucleotide strongly antagonizes hydrolysis. The DNA/RNA hybrid formed by a modified oligodeoxynucleotide and its target RNA could activate RNase H. The 3‘-end-modified antisense oligodeoxynucelotides inhibited S-glycoprotein expression of SARS-CoV at the mRNA levels in insect Sf9 cells. This study indicated the possibility of designing a novel and effective antisense oligodeoxynucleotide by incorporating an isonucleotide at the 3‘-end of the sequence.","chemistry"
"The catalytic inactivation of Escherichia coli in water by a cerium (Ce)-promoted silver-loaded aluminum phosphate (Ag/AlPO4) catalyst using molecular oxygen was investigated. With optimum Ce content, the Ag(Ce)/AlPO4 catalyst exhibited strong bactericidal activity. The process of decomposition of the cell wall and cell membrane was directly observed by TEM. The different morphological changes of E. coli cells treated with the Ag(Ce)/AlPO4 catalyst and those treated with Ag+ suggested that the Ag+ eluted from the catalyst surface did not play an important role during the bactericidal process. Results of DMPO spin-trapping measurements by electron spin resonance (ESR) indicated the formation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) •OH and •O2−, which caused the considerable bactericidal activity. The formation of H2O2 acted as an important intermediate; this was confirmed by addition of catalase as the scavenger. A possible catalytic oxidation bactericidal mechanism using molecular oxygen was proposed for the Ag(Ce)/AlPO4 catalyst.","environmental"
"Identifying the epitope to which an antibody binds is central for many immunological applications such as drug design and vaccine development. The Pepitope server is a web-based tool that aims at predicting discontinuous epitopes based on a set of peptides that were affinity-selected against a monoclonal antibody of interest. The server implements three different algorithms for epitope mapping: PepSurf, Mapitope, and a combination of the two. The rationale behind these algorithms is that the set of peptides mimics the genuine epitope in terms of physicochemical properties and spatial organization. When the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the antigen is known, the information in these peptides can be used to computationally infer the corresponding epitope. A user-friendly web interface and a graphical tool that allows viewing the predicted epitopes were developed. Pepitope can also be applied for inferring other types of protein–protein interactions beyond the immunological context, and as a general tool for aligning linear sequences to a 3D structure.

"SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) has been one of the most severe viral infectious diseases last year and still remains as a highly risky public health problem around the world. Exploring the types of interactions responsible for structural stabilities of its component protein molecules constitutes one of the approaches to find a destabilization method for the virion particle. In this study, we performed a series of experiments to characterize the quaternary structure of the dimeric coronavirus main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro). By using the analytical ultracentrifuge, we demonstrated that the dimeric SARS coronavirus main protease exists as the major form in solution at protein concentration as low as 0.10 mg/mL at neutral pH. The enzyme started to dissociate at acidic and alkali pH values. Ionic strength has profound effect on the dimer stability indicating that the major force involved in the subunit association is ionic interactions. The effect of ionic strength on the protease molecule was reflected by the drastic change of electrostatic potential contour of the enzyme in the presence of NaCl. Analysis of the crystal structures indicated that the interfacial ionic interaction was attributed to the Arg-4···Glu-290 ion pair between the subunits. Detailed examination of the dimer−monomer equilibrium at different pH values reveals apparent pKa values of 8.0 ± 0.2 and 5.0 ± 0.1 for the Arg-4 and Glu-290, respectively. Mutation at these two positions reduces the association affinity between subunits, and the Glu-290 mutants had diminished enzyme activity. This information is useful in searching for substances that can intervene in the subunit association, which is attractive as a target to neutralize the virulence of SARS coronavirus.","biochemistry"

"Objectives Many enveloped viruses carry carbohydrate-containing proteins on their surface. These glycoproteins are key to the infection process as they are mediators of the receptor binding and membrane fusion of the virion with the host cell. Therefore, they are attractive therapeutic targets for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Recently, carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) were shown to possess antiviral activity towards coronaviruses. The current study further elucidates the inhibitory mode of action of CBA. Methods Different strains of two coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, were exposed to CBA: the plant lectins Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) and the non-peptidic mannose-binding antibiotic pradimicin A. Results and conclusions Our results indicate that CBA target the two glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, the spike (S) and membrane (M) protein, of mouse hepatitis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. Furthermore, CBA did not inhibit virus–cell attachment, but rather affected virus entry at a post-binding stage. The sensitivity of coronaviruses towards CBA was shown to be dependent on the processing of the N-linked carbohydrates. Inhibition of mannosidases in host cells rendered the progeny viruses more sensitive to the mannose-binding agents and even to the N-acetylglucosamine-binding UDA. In addition, inhibition of coronaviruses was shown to be dependent on the cell-type used to grow the virus stocks. All together, these results show that CBA exhibit promising capabilities to inhibit coronavirus infections.","pharmacology"
"Immunoadhesins are engineered proteins combining the constant domain (Fc) of an antibody with a ligand‐binding (adhesion) domain. They have significant potential as therapeutic agents, because they maintain the favourable pharmacokinetics of antibodies with an expanded repertoire of ligand‐binding domains: proteins, peptides, or small molecules. We have recently reported that the addition of a cholesterol group to two HIV antibodies can dramatically improve their antiviral potency. Cholesterol, which can be conjugated at various positions in the antibody, including the constant (Fc) domain, endows the conjugate with affinity for the membrane lipid rafts, thus increasing its concentration at the site where viral entry occurs. Here, we extend this strategy to an HIV immunoadhesin, combining a cholesterol‐conjugated Fc domain with the peptide fusion inhibitor C41. The immunoadhesin C41‐Fc‐chol displayed high affinity for Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and when tested on a panel of HIV‐1 strains, it was considerably more potent than the unconjugated C41‐Fc construct. Potentiation of antiviral activity was comparable to what was previously observed for the cholesterol‐conjugated HIV antibodies. Given the key role of cholesterol in lipid raft formation and viral fusion, we expect that the same strategy should be broadly applicable to enveloped viruses, for many of which it is already known the sequence of a peptide fusion inhibitor similar to C41. Moreover, the sequence of heptad repeat‐derived fusion inhibitors can often be predicted from genomic information alone, opening a path to immunoadhesins against emerging viruses.

"The IFNL4 gene is a recently discovered type III interferon, which in a significant fraction of the human population harbours a frameshift mutation abolishing the IFNλ4 ORF. The expression of IFNλ4 is correlated with both poor spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and poor response to treatment with type I interferon. Here, we show that the IFNL4 gene encodes an active type III interferon, named IFNλ4, which signals through the IFNλR1 and IL‐10R2 receptor chains. Recombinant IFNλ4 is antiviral against both HCV and coronaviruses at levels comparable to IFNλ3. However, the secretion of IFNλ4 is impaired compared to that of IFNλ3, and this impairment is not due to a weak signal peptide, which was previously believed. We found that IFNλ4 gets N‐linked glycosylated and that this glycosylation is required for secretion. Nevertheless, this glycosylation is not required for activity. Together, these findings result in the paradox that IFNλ4 is strongly antiviral but a disadvantage during HCV infection.","cell"

"The human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43 and 229E are common causes of upper respiratory tract infections. Severe diseases were rare, however, until the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV in 2003. Since then, other novel CoV (NL63 and HKU1) have been described, and they have caused respiratory infections worldwide. Potentially exposed laboratory workers or animal handlers with rapidly progressive pneumonia not responding to standard antibacterial coverage must be isolated with contact and droplet, and for specific situations, airborne precautions, till rapid tests of respiratory and faecal samples are negative for SARS-CoV. Generally, the viral loads collected at different anatomical sites correlate with the severity of symptoms and mortality. Shedding of SARS-CoV peaks at day 10 after the onset of symptoms, which theoretically allows ample time for antiviral treatment. The disease is characterized by uncontrolled replication of the virus and a prominent pro-inflammatory response. No randomized controlled trials with a specific anti-coronavirus agent have been conducted with respect to therapy or prophylaxis. Reports using historical matched controls have suggested that treatment with interferon alfacon-1 (a synthetic interferon) combined with steroid, protease inhibitors together with ribavirin, or convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody, could be useful. Prophylaxis with interferon or hyperimmune globulin may be considered for unprotected exposure. The role of immunomodulators to decrease excessive inflammation remains elusive. Other non-SARS-CoV infections are generally milder in immunocompetent hosts, and scientific data on antiviral treatment of these viruses are scarce.","pharmacology"

Results In both in vitro models, ATA at concentrations of 100 and 10 µmol/L completely inhibited sporozoites within 10 and 60 min, respectively. Viability of oocysts exposed to 100 µmol/L and assessed by flow cytometry and in cell culture was reduced by 65% and 61%, respectively. The treatment of neonatal mice with a daily ATA dose of 100 µmol/kg led to 97–99% inhibition of infection without any observable negative effects on the animals. In comparison, the mean reduction of infection for paromomycin was 79–84%. Conclusions ATA exerted high anticryptosporidial activity and should be considered for further study.","pharmacology"
"Fibrin deposition was universal in the lungs of SARS patients and fgl2 prothrombinase gene, a novel procoagulant, was demonstrated to express highly in a clinically relevant SARS model. To investigate whether and which structural protein of SARS-CoV induced transcription of hfgl2 prothrombinase gene, three eukaryotic expression plasmids expressing nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M) and spike protein 2 (S2) of SARS-CoV were co-transfected with hfgl2 promoter luciferase-reporter plasmids and β-galactosidase plasmid in CHO cells, respectively. M, N and S2 protein of SARS-CoV were detected by western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. Further assays demonstrated that expression of hfgl2 gene was related with N protein, but not with M or S2 protein in THP-1 cells and Vero cells. N protein significantly induced functional procoagulant activity in comparison with control group. Luciferase assay showed that N protein of SARS-CoV could activate the transcription of hfgl2 promoter compared with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Site-directed mutagenesis and EMSA assay further demonstrated that transcription factor C/EBP alpha band with its cognate cis-element in hfgl2 promoter. The results showed that N protein of SARS-CoV induced hfgl2 gene transcription dependent on the transcription factor C/EBP alpha, which maybe contribute to the development of thrombosis in SARS.","biochemistry"
"Carbohydrate epitopes or glycotopes are structurally diverse, occur in a variety of chemical contexts, and are present on the surfaces of cells in the body and on the surfaces of pathogens. These various structures and modes of presentation affect how they are perceived and processed by the body and dictate the outcome of the immune response directed against them. This review focuses on mechanisms of carbohydrate immunity, with an emphasis on carbohydrate vaccines that have been or are being developed for protection against encapsulated bacterial pathogens. We discuss the cellular basis of carbohydrate immunity, newly identified glycotope processing pathways and recognition capabilities, and the synthetic and microarray technologies that are being developed that will permit new experimental approaches to carbohydrate vaccine development and the exploration of the interaction of the immune system with self and nonself glycans.","microbiology"
"Background. During the outbreak of the emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection, >30% of the ∼8000 infected persons were health care workers. The highly infectious nature of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) compelled our pathologists to consider biosafety issues in the autopsy room and for tissue processing procedures. Methods. A specially designed biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy laboratory was constructed and divided into a clean area, a semicontaminated area, a contaminated area, and 2 buffer zones. High-efficiency particulate air filters were placed in the air supply and exhaust systems. Laminar air flow was from the clean areas to the less clean areas. The negative pressures of the contaminated, semicontaminated, and clean areas were approximately -50 pa, -25 pa, and -5 pa, respectively. Personal protective equipment, including gas mask, impermeable protective clothing, and 3 layers of gloves worn during autopsies; the equipment was decontaminated before it was allowed to exit the facility. Strict BSL-3 practices were followed. Results. When a given concentration of particulate sarin simulant was introduced into the contaminated area, it could not be detected in either the semicontaminated area or clean area, and particles >0.3 μm in size were not detected in the exhaust air. A total of 16 complete postmortem examinations for probable and suspected SARS were performed during a 2-month period. Of these, 7 reported confirmed cases of SARS. None of the 23 pathologists and technicians who participated in these autopsies was infected with SARS-CoV. Conclusions. Our experience suggests that BSL-3 laboratory operating principles should be among the special requirements for performing autopsies of contaminated bodies and that they can safeguard the clinicians and the environment involved in these procedures.","microbiology"
"The main protease of the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome performs proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins. The active form of the enzyme is a homodimer with each subunit consisting of three structural domains. Domains I and II, hosting the complete catalytic machinery, constitute the N-terminal chymotrypsin-like folding scaffold and connect to the extra C-terminal domain III by a long loop. Previously, the domain III-truncated enzyme was demonstrated to fold independently into an intact chymotrypsin-like fold, but it showed no enzyme activity. To further delineate the structure–function relationships of the domain III and the long loop, we generated some truncated and mutated Mpro forms bearing various combinations of the loop with other structural parts of the enzyme. Their conformational and association properties were investigated in detail. Far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) measurements revealed that these fragments could fold independently. The secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of these mixtures were monitored by CD, fluorescence spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. However, no enzyme activity was observed for any mutant or mixtures. These observations indicate that the covalent linkage between the chymotrypsin like and the extra domain is essential for enzymatic activity of the main coronavirus protease and for the integrity of its quaternary structure.","biochemistry"
"Results from optical melting studies of Watson–Crick complementary heteroduplexes formed between 2′-O-methyl RNA and RNA oligonucleotides are used to determine nearest neighbor thermodynamic parameters for predicting the stabilities of such duplexes. The results are consistent with the physical model assumed by the individual nearest neighbor-hydrogen bonding model, which contains terms for helix initiation, base pair stacking and base pair composition. The sequence dependence is similar to that for Watson–Crick complementary RNA/RNA duplexes, which suggests that the sequence dependence may also be similar to that for other backbones that favor A-form RNA conformations.","biochemistry"
"The function of a protein that has no sequence homolog of known function is difficult to assign on the basis of sequence similarity. The same problem may arise for homologous proteins of different functions if one is newly discovered and the other is the only known protein of similar sequence. It is desirable to explore methods that are not based on sequence similarity. One approach is to assign functional family of a protein to provide useful hint about its function. Several groups have employed a statistical learning method, support vector machines (SVMs), for predicting protein functional family directly from sequence irrespective of sequence similarity. These studies showed that SVM prediction accuracy is at a level useful for functional family assignment. But its capability for assignment of distantly related proteins and homologous proteins of different functions has not been critically and adequately assessed. Here SVM is tested for functional family assignment of two groups of enzymes. One consists of 50 enzymes that have no homolog of known function from PSI-BLAST search of protein databases. The other contains eight pairs of homologous enzymes of different families. SVM correctly assigns 72% of the enzymes in the first group and 62% of the enzyme pairs in the second group, suggesting that it is potentially useful for facilitating functional study of novel proteins.

"Avian influenza A virus (an orthomyxovirus) is a zoonotic pathogen with a natural reservoir entirely in birds. The influenza virus genome is an 8-segment single-stranded RNA with high potential for in situ recombination. Two segments code for the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens used for host-cell entry. At present, 16 H and 9 N subtypes are known, for a total of 144 possible different influenza subtypes, each with potentially different host susceptibility. With >10,000 species of birds found in nearly every terrestrial and aquatic habitat, there are few places on earth where birds cannot be found. The avian immune system differs from that of humans in several important features, including asynchronous B and T lymphocyte systems and a polymorphic multigene immune complex, but little is known about the immunogenetics of pathogenic response. Postbreeding dispersal and migration and a naturally high degree of environmental vagility mean that wild birds have the potential to be vectors that transmit highly pathogenic variants great distances from the original sources of infection.","microbiology"
"Probably no topic has generated more excitement in the world of proteomics than the search for biomarkers. This excitement has been generated by two realities: the constant need for better biomarkers that can be used for disease diagnosis and prognosis, and the recent developments in proteomic technologies that are capable of scanning the individual proteins within varying complex clinical samples. Ideally a biomarker would be assayable from a noninvasively collected sample, therefore, much of the focus in proteomics has been on the analysis of biofluids such as serum, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, lymph, etc. While the discovery of biomarkers has been elusive, there have been many advances made in the understanding of the proteome content of various biofluids, and in the technologies used for their analysis, that continues to point the research community toward new methods for achieving the ultimate goal of identifying novel disease‐specific biomarkers. In this review, we will describe and discuss many of the proteomic approaches taken in an attempt to find novel biomarkers in serum, plasma, and lymph.","biochemical"
"The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which controls the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replication, has been identified as a potential target for drug design in the treatment of SARS. A series of tetrapeptide phthalhydrazide ketones, pyridinyl esters, and their analogs have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential SARS 3CLpro inhibitors. Some pyridinyl esters are identified as very potent inhibitors, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (50−65 nM). Electrospray mass spectrometry indicates a mechanism involving acylation of the active site cysteine thiol for this class of inhibitors.","chemistry"
"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized infectious disease that has recently emerged in East Asia and North America. Although the clinical features of acute infection have been well described, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic infections have not been well characterized. Objective. To assess the spectrum of illness in health-care workers (HCWs). Methods. A prospective seroepidemiologic cohort study was conducted on 372 HCWs in a large teaching hospital in Singapore who were both exposed and not exposed to patients with SARS. Participating HCWs completed a questionnaire and provided paired serum samples, which were analyzed by 2 different laboratories blinded to clinical data, by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on a protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a dot-blot immunoassay, with confirmation by a viral neutralization assay. Results. A total of 21 patients with SARS were treated at our hospital. They were associated with transmission to 14 staff members, patients, and visitors in our hospital. Of the 372 HCWs participating in the present study, 8 were found to have positive antibodies to the SARS coronavirus in both samples by use of both test methods, and 6 had pneumonia and had been hospitalized for either probable or suspected SARS infection, whereas 2 had fever but did not have changes on chest radiographs. All seropositive HCWs had been exposed either directly or indirectly to patients with SARS. No asymptomatic, nonexposed staff members were found to be seropositive. There was a trend towards protection for HCWs who, while fully protected, had had contact with patients with SARS. Conclusions. Although the majority of cases of SARS are associated with pneumonia, a small number of mildly symptomatic individuals do seroconvert. HCWs who are exposed to patients with SARS can be infected with SARS, regardless of the intensity of exposure. This has implications for surveillance and infection control planning, in the event that SARS returns next winter.","microbiology"
"Concerns have been raised about the value of genomic research for prevention and public health, especially for complex diseases with risk factors that are amenable to environmental modification. Given that gene-environment interactions underlie almost all human diseases, the public health significance of genomic research on common diseases with modifiable environmental risks is based not necessarily on finding new genetic “causes” but on improving existing approaches to identifying and modifying environmental risk factors to better prevent and treat disease. Such applied genomic research for environmentally caused diseases is important, because 1) it could help stratify disease risks and differentiate interventions for achieving population health benefits; 2) it could help identify new environmental risk factors for disease or help confirm suspected environmental risk factors; and 3) it could aid our understanding of disease occurrence in terms of transmission, natural history, severity, etiologic heterogeneity, and targets for intervention at the population level. While genomics is still in its infancy, opportunities exist for developing, testing, and applying the tools of genomics to clinical and public health research, especially for conditions with known or suspected environmental causes. This research is likely to lead to population-wide health promotion and disease prevention efforts, not only to interventions targeted according to genetic susceptibility.","public"
"Viruses are intracellular pathogens that have to usurp some of the cellular machineries to provide an optimal environment for their own replication. An increasing number of reports reveal that many viruses induce modifications of nuclear substructures including nucleoli, whether they replicate or not in the nucleus of infected cells. Indeed, during infection of cells with various types of human viruses, nucleoli undergo important morphological modifications. A large number of viral components traffic to and from the nucleolus where they interact with different cellular and/or viral factors, numerous host nucleolar proteins are redistributed in other cell compartments or are modified and some cellular proteins are delocalised in the nucleolus of infected cells. Well‐documented studies have established that several of these nucleolar modifications play a role in some steps of the viral cycle, and also in fundamental cellular pathways. The nucleolus itself is the place where several essential steps of the viral cycle take place. In other cases, viruses divert host nucleolar proteins from their known functions in order to exert new unexpected role(s). Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","virology"
"VirGen is a comprehensive viral genome resource that organizes the ‘sequence space’ of viral genomes in a structured fashion. It has been developed with the objective of serving as an annotated and curated database comprising complete genome sequences of viruses, value‐added derived data and data mining tools. The current release (v1.1) contains 559 complete genomes in addition to 287 putative genomes of viruses belonging to eight viral families for which the host range includes animals and plants. Viral genomes in VirGen are annotated using sequence‐based Bioinformatics approaches. The genomic data is also curated to identify ‘alternate names’ of viral proteins, where available. VirGen archives the results of comparisons of genomes, proteomes and individual proteins within and between viral species. It is the first resource to provide phylogenetic trees of viral species computed using whole‐genome sequence data. The module of predicted B‐cell antigenic determinants in VirGen is an attempt to link the genome to its vaccinome. Comparative genome analysis data facilitate the study of genome organization and evolution of viruses, which would have implications in applied research to identify candidates for the design of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

"One of the intriguing characteristics of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics was the occurrence of super spreading events (SSEs). Here, the authors report the results of identifying the occurrence of SSEs in the Hong Kong and Singapore epidemics using mathematical and statistical analysis. Their predicted occurrence of SSEs agreed well with the reported occurrence of all seven super spreaders in the two cities. Additional unidentified SSEs were also found to exist. It was found that 71.1% and 74.8% of the infections were attributable to SSEs in Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. There also seemed to be “synchronized” occurrences of infection peaks in both the community and the hospitals in Hong Kong. The results strongly suggested that the infection did not depend on the total number of symptomatic cases, with only a very small proportion of symptomatic individuals being shown to be infectious (i.e., able to infect other individuals). The authors found that the daily infection rate did not correlate with the daily total number of symptomatic cases but with the daily number of symptomatic cases who were not admitted to a hospital within 4 days of the onset of symptoms.","public"
"Abstract  Abstract  When considering how people are infected and what can be done to prevent the infections, answers from many disciplines are sought: microbiology, epidemiology, medicine, engineering, and physics. There are many pathways to infection spread, and among the most significant from the epidemiological point of view is airborne transport. Microorganisms can become airborne when droplets are generated during speech, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, or atomization of feces during sewage removal. The fate of the droplets is governed by the physical principles of transport, with droplet size being the most important factor affecting their dispersion, deposition on surfaces and determining the survival of microorganisms within the droplets. In addition, physical characteristics of the indoor environment as well as the design and operation of building ventilation systems are of critical importance. Do we understand the mechanisms of infection spread and can we quantify the droplet dynamics under various indoor conditions? Unfortunately no, as this aspect of infection spread has attracted surprisingly little scientific interest. However, investigations of numerous cases in which a large number of people were infected show how critical the physics of microorganism spread can be. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding mechanisms of droplet spread and solutions available to minimize the spread and prevent infections.","public"
"Abstract  Abstract  In the worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, cluster of cases occurred in a number of large high‐rise residential building blocks, especially in Hong Kong. In this study, we examined one of the most likely virus‐spread mechanisms, which is related to the inter‐flat or inter‐zonal airflow through open‐windows caused by buoyancy effects. Dual tracer gases of CO2 and SF6 are employed simultaneously to quantify the amount of the exhaust air coming out of the upper part of the window of a floor that re‐enters the lower part of the open‐window at the immediate upper floor. It was found that the room air could contain up to 7% of the exhaust air from the lower floor, and this occurs at low wind conditions with a combination of indoor–outdoor temperature difference. The results can well explain the earlier governmental finding that DNA strings of SARS Corono‐Virus were detected within the sampled deposits on the window sills of the upper floors of the two index patients’ flats. The preliminary and yet alarming conclusion may be that, in high‐rise buildings, windows flush with a flat façade can be a major route for the vertical spread of pathogen‐containing aerosols.","public"
"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a human disease in 2002. Detailed phylogenetic analysis and epidemiologic studies have suggested that the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originated from animals. The spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as a major target of protective immunity and contains ⩾ 3 regions that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the S1 and S2 domains. We previously characterized a panel of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), but the majority of epitopes recognized by the MAbs remain unknown. Methods. In the present study, we generated neutralization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutralization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as on in vitro and in vivo fitness. Results. Distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of MAbs with differential neutralization profiles. We also identified possible interactions between the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Finally, we showed that escape from neutralization usually attenuates SARS-CoV infection. Conclusions. These data provide a mechanism for overcoming neutralization escape by use of broadly cross- reactive cocktails of cross-neutralizing MAbs that recognize residues within the receptor-binding domain that are critical for virus replication and virulence.","microbiology"
"A potent SARS coronavirus (CoV) 3CL protease inhibitor (TG-0205221, Ki = 53 nM) has been developed. TG-0205221 showed remarkable activity against SARS CoV and human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E replications by reducing the viral titer by 4.7 log (at 5 μM) for SARS CoV and 5.2 log (at 1.25 μM) for HCoV 229E. The crystal structure of TG-0205221 (resolution = 1.93 Å) has revealed a unique binding mode comprising a covalent bond, hydrogen bonds, and numerous hydrophobic interactions. Structural comparisons between TG-0205221 and a natural peptide substrate were also discussed. This information may be applied toward the design of other 3CL protease inhibitors.","chemistry"
"Therapeutic application of the recently discovered small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing phenomenon will be dependent on improvements in molecule bio-stability, specificity and delivery. To address these issues, we have systematically modified siRNA with the synthetic RNA-like high affinity nucleotide analogue, Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA). Here, we show that incorporation of LNA substantially enhances serum half-life of siRNA's, which is a key requirement for therapeutic use. Moreover, we provide evidence that LNA is compatible with the intracellular siRNA machinery and can be used to reduce undesired, sequence-related off-target effects. LNA-modified siRNAs targeting the emerging disease SARS, show improved efficiency over unmodified siRNA on certain RNA motifs. The results from this study emphasize LNA's promise in converting siRNA from a functional genomics technology to a therapeutic platform.","biochemistry"
"We have previously reported that antibodies directed against the cytomegalovirus-derived protein UL94 cross react with the cell surface tetraspanin transmembrane 4 superfamily member 7 (TM4SF7 or NAG-2) molecule inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells and activation of fibroblasts in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). We aimed at generating a non-functional mAb directed against NAG-2 from patients’ memory B cells. Direct and competitive ELISA methods have been used to evaluate the binding of antibodies from scleroderma patients’ and controls’ sera to the NAG-2 peptide. IgG memory B cells were sorted, EBV transformed and cloned to obtain NAG-2-specific mAbs. Endothelial cells and fibroblasts were cultured under standard conditions and used for functional assays. Anti-NAG-2-purified antibodies obtained from patients’ Ig induce endothelial cell apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation. Patients’ Igs depleted of the anti-NAG-2 fraction do not exert such functional activity. Therefore, the NAG-2 molecule represents a potential novel candidate for therapeutic intervention in SSc. Here, we describe the generation of a human mAb directed against the NAG-2 molecule. Such mAb does not retain any functional property and is able to block the effect of serum pathogenetic anti-NAG-2 antibodies. The majority of SSc patients present antibodies directed against tetraspanin NAG-2 and mediate both endothelial cell apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation, features of the disease. The anti-NAG-2 human mAb we have obtained blocks signal transduction and therefore may be a potential candidate for a new treatment in SSc, a disease where the current biological therapies have little or no efficacy.","immunology"
"Objectives Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes serious diseases in humans. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) on EV71 replication and to explore the underlying mechanism. Methods To measure the activity of ATA in inhibiting the cytopathic effect (CPE) of EV71, a cell-based neutralization (inhibition of virus-induced CPE) assay was performed. The effect of ATA was further confirmed using plaque reduction and viral yield reduction assays. A time of addition assay was performed to identify the mechanisms of ATA's anti-EV71 activity. We examined the effects of ATA on the following key steps involved in virus replication: (i) translation of the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated viral polyprotein; (ii) the proteolytic activity of viral proteases 2A and/or 3C; and (iii) the viral 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. Results In this study, ATA was found to be a potent inhibitor of the replication of EV71. In the antiviral neutralization assay, ATA exhibited inhibitory activity against EV71 (TW/4643/98) and EV71 (TW/2231/98). Plaque assay further demonstrated that ATA inhibited EV71 replication with an EC50 (effective concentration at which 50% of plaques were removed) of 2.9 µM. Studies on the mechanism of action revealed that ATA targets the early stage of the viral life cycle after viral entry. ATA was able to inhibit the RdRp activity of EV71, while neither the IRES-mediated translation of viral polyprotein nor the viral 3C protease activity was affected. Conclusions Overall, the findings in this study suggest that ATA is able to effectively inhibit EV71 replication through interfering with the viral 3D polymerase.","pharmacology"
"Using a comprehensive set of discovery and optimization tools, antibodies were produced with the ability to neutralize SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in Vero E6 cells and in animal models. These anti-SARS antibodies were discovered using a novel DNA display method, which can identify new antibodies within days. Once neutralizing antibodies were identified, a comprehensive and effective means of converting the mouse sequences to human frameworks was accomplished using HuFR™ (human framework reassembly) technology. The best variant (61G4) from this screen showed a 3.5–4-fold improvement in neutralization of SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Finally, using a complete site-saturation mutagenesis methodology focused on the CDR (complementarity determining regions), a single point mutation (51E7) was identified that improved the 80% plaque reduction neutralization of the virus by greater than 8-fold.

"Carbohydrate structures, including Lewis X (Lex), which is not synthesized in mutant mice that lack α1,3‐fucosyltransferase 9 (Fut9−/−), are involved in cell–cell recognition and inflammation. However, immunological alteration in Fut9−/− mice has not been studied. Thus, the inflammatory response of Fut9−/− mice was examined using the highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHMV srr7 strain. Pathological study revealed that inflammation induced in the brains of Fut9−/− mice after infection was more extensive compared with that of wild‐type mice, although viral titers obtained from the brains of mutant mice were lower than those of wild‐type mice. Furthermore, the reduction in cell numbers in the spleens of wild‐type mice after infection was not observed in the infected Fut9−/− mice. Although there were no clear differences in the levels of cytokines examined in the brains between Fut9−/− and wild‐type mice except for interferon‐β (IFN‐β) expression, some of those in the spleens, including interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 (MCP‐1), showed higher levels in Fut9−/− than in wild‐type mice. Furthermore, Fut9−/− mice were refractory to the in vivo inoculation of endotoxin (LPS) compared with wild‐type mice.

"To identify the function of HAb18G/CD147 in invasion of host cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), we analyzed the protein-protein interaction among HAb18G/CD147, cyclophilin A (CyPA), and SARS-CoV structural proteins by coimmunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Although none of the SARS-CoV proteins was found to be directly bound to HAb18G/CD147, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV was bound to CyPA, which interacted with HAb18G/CD147. Further research showed that HAb18G/CD147, a transmembrane molecule, was highly expressed on 293 cells and that CyPA was integrated with SARS-CoV. HAb18G/CD147–antagonistic peptide (AP)–9, an AP of HAb18G/CD147, had a high rate of binding to 293 cells and an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV. These results show that HAb18G/CD147, mediated by CyPA bound to SARS-CoV N protein, plays a functional role in facilitating invasion of host cells by SARS-CoV. Our findings provide some evidence for the cytologic mechanism of invasion by SARS-CoV and provide a molecular basis for screening anti-SARS drugs","microbiology"
"Fourteen cytokines or chemokines were analyzed on 88 RT‐PCR‐confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. IFN‐γ, IL‐18, TGF‐β, IL‐6, IP‐10, MCP‐1, MIG, and IL‐8, but not of TNF‐α, IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐10, IL‐13, or TNFRI, were highly elevated in the acute phase sera of Taiwan SARS patients. IFN‐γ was significantly higher in the Ab(+) group than in the Ab(−) group. IFN‐γ, IL‐18, MCP‐1, MIG, and IP‐10 were already elevated at early days post fever onset. Furthermore, levels of IL‐18, IP‐10, MIG, and MCP‐1 were significantly higher in the death group than in the survival group. For the survival group, IFN‐γ and MCP‐1 were inversely associated with circulating lymphocytes count and monocytes count, but positively associated with circulating neutrophils count. It is concluded that an interferon‐γ‐related cytokine storm was induced post SARS coronavirus infection, and this cytokine storm might be involved in the immunopathological damage in SARS patients.

"In the winter season 2001–2002, 239 nasopharyngeal aspirate and 15 bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 208 patients (135 pediatric and 73 adults, including 19 lung transplant recipients) admitted to hospital because of an acute respiratory tract infection were examined for rapid diagnosis of respiratory viruses by two diagnostic approaches: immunological, using specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb); and molecular, using specific reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR assays. Both methods detected influenza viruses A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B, human parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) types A and B, and human adenoviruses. In addition, human coronavirus (hCoV) groups I (229E‐like) and II (OC43‐like), as well as the new human metapneumovirus (hMPV), types A and B, were searched for by RT‐PCR alone. When results obtained by both methods were added, the overall percentage of patients positive for at least one respiratory virus peaked at 44.2%, involving 92/208 patients (81 pediatric, and 11 adults), while 116 patients (55.8%) were negative for any respiratory virus tested. The most common circulating virus was hRSV, infecting 54 (25.9%) patients (24 type A, and 30 type B strains), followed by hMPV, infecting 12 (5.8%) patients (7 type A and 5 type B strains). Coinfections by two respiratory viruses interested 11 (5.3%) patients, and 9 (81.8%) of these were infected by hRSV in association with another respiratory virus. In the great majority of infected children, hRSV and hMPV were associated with lower respiratory tract infections. In lung transplant recipients, viruses present in bronchoalveolar lavage appeared to be associated frequently with lower respiratory tract infections. In conclusion: the combination of immunological and molecular assays is the most sensitive approach to the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections; and infections caused by the less investigated hCoVs and hMPVs represent a fair proportion of respiratory infections.

The whole procedure is very simple and rapid wherein the amplification can be completed in less than 1 h under isothermal conditions employing a set of six specially designed primers spanning eight distinct sequences of a target gene, by incubating all the reagents in a single tube. Gene amplification products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as by real‐time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. Gene copy number can also be quantified with the help of a standard curve generated from different concentrations of gene copy number plotted against time of positivity with the help of a real‐time turbidimeter. Alternatively, gene amplification can be visualised by the naked eye either as turbidity or in the form of a colour change when SYBR Green I, a fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye, is employed. LAMP does not require a thermal cycler and can be performed simply with a heating block and/or water bath. Considering the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation and easy detection, LAMP has potential applications for clinical diagnosis as well as surveillance of infectious diseases in developing countries without requiring sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel.

"The influence of locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes is reported. Optical melting studies indicate that LNA incorporated into an otherwise 2′-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide usually, but not always, enhances the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA. Several trends are apparent, including: (i) a 3′ terminal U LNA and 5′ terminal LNAs are less stabilizing than interior and other 3′ terminal LNAs; (ii) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide; and (iii) the effects of LNA substitutions are approximately additive when the LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide. An equation is proposed to approximate the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA when at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide separates LNA nucleotides. The sequence dependence of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes appears to be similar to that of RNA/RNA duplexes, and preliminary nearest-neighbor free energy increments at 37°C are presented for 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes. Internal mismatches with LNA nucleotides significantly destabilize duplexes with RNA.","biochemistry"
"Inhalation of nitric oxide (NO) improved arterial oxygenation and enabled the reduction of inspired oxygen therapy and airway pressure support in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In addition, chest radiography showed decreased spread or density of lung infiltrates, and the physiological effects remained after termination of inhaled NO therapy. These findings suggest not only a pulmonary vasodilator effect of inhaled NO, but also an effect on SARS.","microbiology"
"Background. The diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is difficult early in the illness, because its presentation resembles that of other nonspecific viral fevers, such as dengue. Dengue fever is endemic in many of the countries in which the large SARS outbreaks occurred in early 2003. Misdiagnosis may have serious public health consequences. We aimed to determine simple laboratory features to differentiate SARS from dengue. Methods. We compared the laboratory features of 55 adult patients with SARS at presentation (who were all admitted before radiological changes had occurred) and 147 patients with dengue. Features independently predictive of dengue were modeled by multivariate logistic regression to create a diagnostic tool with 100% specificity for dengue. Results. Multivariate analysis identified 3 laboratory features that together are highly predictive of a diagnosis of dengue and able to rule out the possibility of SARS: platelet count of <140 × 109 platelets/L, white blood cell count of <5 × 109cells/L, and aspartate aminotransferase level of >34 IU/L. A combination of these parameters has a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusions. Simple laboratory data may be helpful for the diagnosis of disease in adults admitted because of fever in areas in which dengue is endemic when the diagnosis of SARS needs to be excluded. Application of this information may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients presenting with nonspecific fever.","microbiology"

Substitutions at the N-1 and C-5 positions were examined to elucidate the differences in substrate binding sites of the rhinovirus 3C protease and SARS CoV 3C-like protease. Compound 5f shows significant inhibition with an IC50 of 0.37 μM.

"We identified 1113 articles (103 reviews, 1010 primary research articles) published in 2005 that describe experiments performed using commercially available optical biosensors. While this number of publications is impressive, we find that the quality of the biosensor work in these articles is often pretty poor. It is a little disappointing that there appears to be only a small set of researchers who know how to properly perform, analyze, and present biosensor data. To help focus the field, we spotlight work published by 10 research groups that exemplify the quality of data one should expect to see from a biosensor experiment. Also, in an effort to raise awareness of the common problems in the biosensor field, we provide side‐by‐side examples of good and bad data sets from the 2005 literature.

"BackgroundIn developed nations, Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children. An infectious etiology is likely but has not yet been identified. We have previously reported that oligoclonal immunoglobulin A plasma cells infiltrate acute KD tissues and that synthetic KD antibodies detect a distinctive spheroidal antigen in acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium MethodsTo further characterize the antigen in acute KD bronchi, we examined paraffin-embedded ciliated bronchial epithelium using light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ResultsThe spheroids observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) are visualized as inclusion bodies with hematoxylin-eosin and nucleic acid stains and in methylene blue/azure II/basic fuchsin trichrome–stained plastic sections, suggesting the presence of both protein and nucleic acid. The structures visualized by LM correspond to homogeneous electron-dense perinuclear inclusion bodies (up to 1.4 microns in diameter) in ciliated bronchial epithelium from 4 patients with acute KD examined by TEM. Inclusion bodies were not present in control bronchial epithelium or in nonciliated cells ConclusionsThe antigen detected in acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium by IHC with synthetic KD antibodies resides in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are consistent with aggregates of viral proteins and associated nucleic acid and may derive from the etiologic agent of KD","microbiology"
"With the persistent threat of emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism, it has become increasingly important that clinicians be able to identify the diseases that might signal the occurrence of these unusual events. Essential to a thoughtful diagnostic approach is understanding when to initiate a public health investigation and how to appropriately use commonly performed microbiology procedures in the sentinel laboratory to evaluate potential pathogens. Although diagnostic test development is evolving rapidly, recognizing many of these pathogens continues to challenge the capabilities of most sentinel laboratories. Therefore, effective, ongoing communication and education among clinicians, infection control personnel, sentinel laboratorians, public health authorities, and Laboratory Response Network reference laboratorians is the key to preparedness.","microbiology"
"Background.  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has impacted heavily on both Canada's society and its health care system. Quite unexpectedly, hospitals and health care workers became facilitators of disease diffusion. This experience has demonstrated the need for a comprehensive disease control strategy. Aims.  The aims are threefold. First, to examine the subtle and changing spatial characteristics of SARS during the short but critical period of its rapid spread in the Greater Toronto Area. Second, to make salient three paradoxes, and their associated dilemmas, faced by nurses and other health care professionals challenged with caring for the sick and containing the rapid spread of the disease. Third, to propose some ways of approaching these dilemmas, as well as some broader preventative and mitigating strategies. Methods.  The crosscutting concepts of ‘clinical uncertainty’ and ‘flow of human contacts’ are used to explain disease transmission characteristics and urban spatial diffusion and to guide the particular strategies developed. Evidence for the paper comes from public health records, governmental and non‐governmental health statements and the initial epidemiological research on SARS. Direct insights are also gained from recent first‐hand experiences of Toronto's health care system during the crisis. Discussion.  The concepts of clinical uncertainty and the flow of human contacts provide in‐depth insights that complement the findings of large‐scale epidemiological studies, and help operationalize their general calls for enhanced control measures. The comprehensive disease control strategy proposed includes the creation of a hospital infrastructure specific to the containment of biological threats; an advisory coalition of disease control specialists; the development of a biological threat‐and‐containment simulation laboratory and three specific programmes in patient safety, risk assessment and community mobilization. Conclusion.  It is argued that containment alone, while a necessary and urgent priority, cannot be seen as an end in itself and might better be understood as one possible trajectory within a comprehensive problem‐solving strategy. The experiences in Toronto may offer insights to other cities and countries that currently lack such strategies and hence may be vulnerable to similar outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases.","nursing"
"The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS‐CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS‐CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole‐body level, immune‐mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

"The small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat protein (SGT) belongs to a family of cochaperones that interacts with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 via the so-called TPR domain. Here, we present the crystal structure of the TPR domain of human SGT (SGT-TPR), which shows that it contains typical features found in the structures of other TPR domains. Previous studies show that full-length SGT can bind to both Vpu and Gag of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the overexpression of SGT in cells reduces the efficiency of HIV-1 particle release. We show that SGT-TPR can bind Vpu and reduce the amount of HIV-1 p24, which is the viral capsid, secreted from cells transfected with the HIV-1 proviral construct, albeit at a lower efficiency than full-length SGT. This indicates that the TPR domain of SGT is sufficient for the inhibition of HIV-1 particle release but the N- and/or C-terminus also have some contributions. The SGT binding site in Vpu was also identified by using peptide array and confirmed by GST pull-down assay.","biochemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a worldwide epidemic caused by a coronavirus that has a cysteine protease (3CLpro) essential to its life cycle. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic methods were used with highly active 3CLpro to characterize the reaction mechanism. We show that 3CLpro has mechanistic features common and disparate to the archetypical proteases papain and chymotrypsin. The kinetic mechanism for 3CLpro-mediated ester hydrolysis, including the individual rate constants, is consistent with a simple double displacement mechanism. The pre-steady-state burst rate was independent of ester substrate concentration indicating a high commitment to catalysis. When homologous peptidic amide and ester substrates were compared, a series of interesting observations emerged. Despite a 2000-fold difference in nonenzymatic reactivity, highly related amide and ester substrates were found to have similar kinetic parameters in both the steady-state and pre-steady-state. Steady-state solvent isotope effect (SIE) studies showed an inverse SIE for the amide but not ester substrates. Evaluation of the SIE in the pre-steady-state revealed normal SIEs for both amide and ester burst rates. Proton inventory (PI) studies on amide peptide hydrolysis were consistent with two proton-transfer reactions in the transition state while the ester data was consistent with a single proton-transfer reaction. Finally, the pH-inactivation profile of 3CLpro with iodoacetamide is indicative of an ion-pair mechanism. Taken together, the data are consistent with a 3CLpro mechanism that utilizes an “electrostatic” trigger to initiate the acylation reaction, a cysteine−histidine catalytic dyad ion pair, an enzyme-facilitated release of P1, and a general base-catalyzed deacylation reaction.","biochemistry"
"The mannose binding proteins on the surface of the dendritic cells are responsible for capture of pathogens in the early stages of immune response. Conjugation to mannose dendrimers is a rarely explored but potentially powerful strategy for enhancing immunogenicity of synthetic peptides relying on direct delivery to dendritic cells. We describe a general protocol for preparation of pure, monodisperse third‐generation mannosylated poly‐L‐lysine dendrimer‐peptide conjugates using direct, machine‐assisted Fmoc/t‐Bu solid phase peptide synthesis. The glycodendrons were elaborated onto the N‐ or C‐terminus of sequences derived from HIV‐1 gp41, SARS‐CoV S2 protein, and Influenza Hemagglutinin (consisting of 15–44 residues).

"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Development of drug resistance against clinical anti-HBV drug lamivudine due to long-term use and rebound of viral DNA after cessation of treatment has been a major setback of the current therapy. We have synthesized a series of pyrimidine nucleosides possessing a variety of substituents at the C-5 position, and a 1-[(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy)methyl] flexible acyclic glycosyl moiety at the N-1 position, that have the ability to mimic the natural 2‘-deoxyribosyl moiety. Some of these potential antiviral compounds included variations at both C-5 and C-6 positions of the uracil base. Other variations of the uracil derivatives were the 6-aza congeners. 4-Amino and 4-methoxy pyrimidine derivatives were also made. Compounds in which the base moiety was substituted by 5-chloro- (25), 5-(2-bromovinyl)- (32), or 5-bromo-6-methyl- (37) groups possess significant activity against duck-HBV, wild-type human HBV (2.2.15 cells), and lamivudine-resistant HBV containing single and double mutations. No cytotoxicity was seen in host HepG2 and Vero cells, up to the highest concentration tested. The anti-HBV activity exhibited by compounds 25, 32, and 37 was superior for human HBV and comparable for DHBV to that of the corresponding purine nucleoside, ganciclovir. Further, they were only 10−15-fold less inhibitory against human HBV in 2.2.15 cells than the reference drug, lamivudine. Other compounds in the series were moderately inhibitory against DHBV and wild-type human HBV. The size of the halogen and the electronegativity of the substituents at the 5- and 6-positions are important for antiviral activity toward HBV. These compounds were also evaluated for their antiviral activity for West Nile virus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus. They were generally inactive in these antiviral assay systems (at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL). 1-[(2-Hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethoxy)methyl]-5-fluorocytosine (34) showed some inhibitory activity against hepatitis C virus. Taken together, these data support our previous observations that the 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleosides containing acyclic glycosyl moieties have potential to serve as a new generation of potent, selective, and nontoxic anti-HBV agents for wild-type and lamivudine-resistant mutant HBV.","chemistry"
"During the course of an epidemic of a potentially fatal disease, it is important that the case fatality ratio be well estimated. The authors propose a novel method for doing so based on the Kaplan-Meier survival procedure, jointly considering two outcomes (death and recovery), and evaluate its performance by using data from the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong, People's Republic of China. They compare this estimate obtained at various points in the epidemic with the case fatality ratio eventually observed; with two commonly quoted, naïve estimates derived from cumulative incidence and mortality statistics at single time points; and with estimates in which a parametric mixture model is used. They demonstrate the importance of patient characteristics regarding outcome by analyzing subgroups defined by age at admission to the hospital.","public"
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope spike (S) glycoprotein, a class I viral fusion protein, is responsible for the fusion between the membranes of the virus and the target cell. The S2 domain of protein S has been suggested to have two fusion peptides, one located at its N-terminus, downstream of the furin cleavage, and another, more internal, located immediately upstream of the HR1. Therefore, we have carried out a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide corresponding to segment 873−888 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, peptide SARSIFP, as well as the structural changes taking place in both the phospholipid and the peptide induced by the binding of the peptide to the membrane. We demonstrate that SARSIFP peptide binds to and interacts with phospholipid model membranes and shows a higher affinity for negatively charged phospholipids than for zwitterionic ones. SARSIFP peptide specifically decreases the mobility of the phospholipid acyl chains of negatively charged phospholipids and adopts different conformations in the membrane depending upon their composition. These data support its role in SARS-mediated membrane fusion and suggest that the regions where this peptide resides might assist the fusion peptide and/or the pretransmembrane segment of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein in the fusion process.","biochemistry"
"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) exhibits a Type I interferon (IFN) antagonistic function. This study characterizes Type I IFN antagonism mechanism of NS5 protein, using proteomic approach. In human neuroblastoma cells, NS5 expression would suppress IFNβ‐induced responses, for example, expression of IFN‐stimulated genes PKR and OAS as well as STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation. Proteomic analysis showed JEV NS5 downregulating calreticulin, while upregulating cyclophilin A, HSP 60 and stress‐induced‐phosphoprotein 1. Gene silence of calreticulin raised intracellular Ca2+ levels while inhibiting nuclear translocalization of STAT1 and NFAT‐1 in response to IFNβ, thus, indicating calreticulin downregulation linked with Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5 via activation of Ca2+/calicineurin. Calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A attenuated NS5‐mediated inhibition of IFNβ‐induced responses, for example, IFN‐sensitive response element driven luciferase, STAT1‐dependent PKR mRNA expression, as well as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1. Transfection with calcineurin (vs. control) siRNA enhanced nuclear translocalization of STAT1 and upregulated PKR expression in NS5‐expressing cells in response to IFNβ. Results prove Ca2+, calreticulin, and calcineurin involvement in STAT1‐mediated signaling as well as a key role of JEV NS5 in Type I IFN antagonism. This study offers insights into the molecular mechanism of Type I interferon antagonism by JEV NS5.","biochemistry"

We believe that this approach has provided a platform for further lead optimization.","chemistry"
"The envelope glycoproteins of the class I family, which include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), mediate viral entry by first binding to their cellular receptors and subsequently inducing fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. In the case of SARS-CoV, heptad repeat domains of the envelope glycoprotein, termed S2-HR1 and S2-HR2, are thought to undergo structural changes from a prefusion state, in which S2-HR1 and S2-HR2 do not interact, to a postfusion state in which S2-HR1 and S2-HR2 associate to form a six-helix bundle. In the present work, the structural and dynamic properties of S2-HR2 have been characterized. Evidence is presented for an equilibrium between a structured trimer thought to represent a prefusion state and an ensemble of unstructured monomers thought to represent a novel transition state. A model for viral entry is presented in which S2-HR2 is in a dynamic equilibrium between an ensemble of unstructured monomers in the transition state and a structured trimer in the prefusion state. Conversion from the prefusion state to the postfusion state requires passage through the transition state, a state that may give insight into the design of structure-based antagonists of SARS-CoV in particular, as well as other enveloped viruses in general.","biochemistry"
"The study of type III RNases constitutes an important area in molecular biology. It is known that the pac1+ gene encodes a particular RNase III that shares low amino acid similarity with other genes despite having a double-stranded ribonuclease activity. Bioinformatics methods based on sequence alignment may fail when there is a low amino acidic identity percentage between a query sequence and others with similar functions (remote homologues) or a similar sequence is not recorded in the database. Quantitative structure−activity relationships (QSAR) applied to protein sequences may allow an alignment-independent prediction of protein function. These sequences of QSAR-like methods often use 1D sequence numerical parameters as the input to seek sequence-function relationships. However, previous 2D representation of sequences may uncover useful higher-order information. In the work described here we calculated for the first time the spectral moments of a Markov matrix (MMM) associated with a 2D-HP-map of a protein sequence. We used MMMs values to characterize numerically 81 sequences of type III RNases and 133 proteins of a control group. We subsequently developed one MMM-QSAR and one classic hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the same data. The MMM-QSAR showed a discrimination power of RNAses from other proteins of 97.35% without using alignment, which is a result as good as for the known HMM techniques. We also report for the first time the isolation of a new Pac1 protein (DQ647826) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 428-4-1. The MMM-QSAR model predicts the new RNase III with the same accuracy as other classical alignment methods. Experimental assay of this protein confirms the predicted activity. The present results suggest that MMM-QSAR models may be used for protein function annotation avoiding sequence alignment with the same accuracy of classic HMM models.","computer"
"The study investigated the general population's perceived infectivity of asymptomatic and recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients and factors associated with avoidance and discriminatory attitudes, including demographic background, SARS-related perceptions and emotional response to the SARS epidemic. A population-based survey was conducted in Hong Kong during 3 December 2003 through 4 January 2004; 475 Hong Kong Chinese adults participated in the survey. Perceptions of the infectivity and health conditions of recovered SARS patients and avoidance and discrimination towards them were measured. Of the respondents, 75.7% and 16.2%, respectively, believed that SARS could be transmitted via asymptomatic SARS patients and those patients who have recovered from SARS for 18 months; 72.7% of the respondents believed that the health of SARS patients would severely and permanently be damaged; 16.6% showed some tendency of avoiding recovered SARS patients and 35.7% expressed some sort of job-related discriminatory attitudes. Perceived infectivity of asymptomatic and recovered SARS patients, health sequelae and emotional distress from SARS were independently associated with avoidance and discriminatory attitudes. The study showed that misconceptions about the infectivity of asymptomatic and recovered SARS patients were common. Recovered SARS patients may also be facing avoidance and discrimination.","public"
"The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) provided an opportunity to study the antibody response of infected individuals to the causative virus, SARS coronavirus. We examined serum samples obtained from 46 patients with SARS, 40 patients with non-SARS pneumonia, and 38 healthy individuals, by use of Western blotting (WB), enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), and immunofluorescence assay, using both native and bacterially produced antigens of the virus. We found a highly restricted, immunoglobulin G-dominated antibody response in patients with SARS, directed most frequently (89% by ELISA) and predominantly at the nucleocapsid. Almost all of the subjects without SARS had no antinucleocapsid antibodies. The spike protein was the next most frequently targeted, but only 63% of the patients (by ELISA) responded. Other targets of the response identified by use of WB included antigens of 80 and 60 kDa. Several nonstructural proteins cloned were not antigenic, and the culture-derived nucleocapsid appeared to be specifically degraded.","microbiology"

Moreover, the frequency of B*0703 and B60 coinheritance (9.6%; 95% CI, 4.6%–19.0%) in our SARS group was significantly higher (P = 3×10−9) than that expected in the general population (0.4%).

"Current biotechnological applications such as biosensors, protein arrays, and microchips require oriented immobilization of enzymes. The characteristics of recognition, self‐assembly and ease of genetic manipulation make inorganic binding peptides an ideal molecular tool for site‐specific enzyme immobilization. Herein, we demonstrate the utilization of gold binding peptide (GBP1) as a molecular linker genetically fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP) and immobilized on gold substrate. Multiple tandem repeats (n = 5, 6, 7, 9) of gold binding peptide were fused to N‐terminus of AP (nGBP1‐AP) and the enzymes were expressed in E. coli cells. The binding and enzymatic activities of the bi‐functional fusion constructs were analyzed using quartz crystal microbalance spectroscopy and biochemical assays. Among the multiple‐repeat constructs, 5GBP1‐AP displayed the best bi‐functional activity and, therefore, was chosen for self‐immobilization studies. Adsorption and assembly properties of the fusion enzyme, 5GBP1‐AP, were studied via surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. We demonstrated self‐immobilization of the bi‐functional enzyme on micro‐patterned substrates where genetically linked 5GBP1‐AP displayed higher enzymatic activity per area compared to that of AP. Our results demonstrate the promising use of inorganic binding peptides as site‐specific molecular linkers for oriented enzyme immobilization with retained activity. Directed assembly of proteins on solids using genetically fused specific inorganic‐binding peptides has a potential utility in a wide range of biosensing and bioconversion processes. Biotechnol.

"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are extensively expressed in mammalian cells and play a crucial role as RNA regulators in various cellular processes. Increasing data reveal that they function in innate antiviral immunity through complex mechanisms. Thousands of lncRNAs are regulated by RNA virus or DNA virus infection. The significant differential expression of lncRNAs is induced by virus or host antiviral signaling mediated by interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor‐α. In turn, these lncRNAs modulate the host immune response including the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR)‐related signaling, the translocation and activation of transcription factors, the production of IFNs and cytokines, the IFN‐activated JAK‐STAT signaling and the transcription of antiviral IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Using gain‐ or loss‐of‐function analysis, the effect of lncRNAs on viral replication has been investigated to elucidate the essential role of lncRNA in the host–virus interaction. lncRNAs have shown specifically elevated or decreased levels in patients with viral diseases, suggesting the possibility of clinical application as biomarkers. Here we review the current advances of viral infection‐associated host lncRNAs, their functional significance in different aspects of antiviral immune response, the specific mechanisms and unsolved issues. We also summarize the regulation of lncRNAs by viruses, PRR agonists and cytokines. In addition, virus‐encoded lncRNAs and their functional involvement in host–virus interaction are addressed.

"Viral nucleocapsid proteins (NCs) enwrap the RNA genomes of viruses to form NC–RNA complexes, which act as a template and are essential for viral replication and transcription. Beyond packaging viral RNA, NCs also play important roles in virus replication, transcription, assembly, and budding by interacting with viral and host cellular proteins. Additionally, NCs can inhibit interferon signaling response and function in cell stress response, such as inducing apoptosis. Finally, NCs can be the target of vaccines, benefiting from their conserved gene sequences. Here, we summarize important findings regarding the additional functions of NCs as much more than structural RNA‐binding proteins, with specific emphasis on (1) their association with the viral life cycle, (2) their association with host cells, and (3) as ideal candidates for vaccine development.

"The process of inferring phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences almost always starts with a multiple alignment of these sequences but can also be based on methods that do not involve multiple sequence alignment. Very little is known about the accuracy with which such alignment-free methods recover the correct phylogeny or about the potential for increasing their accuracy. We conducted a large-scale comparison of ten alignment-free methods, among them one new approach that does not calculate distances and a faster variant of our pattern-based approach; all distance-based alignment-free methods are freely available from http://www.bioinformatics.org.au (as Python package decaf+py). We show that most methods exhibit a higher overall reconstruction accuracy in the presence of high among-site rate variation. Under all conditions that we considered, variants of the pattern-based approach were significantly better than the other alignment-free methods. The new pattern-based variant achieved a speed-up of an order of magnitude in the distance calculation step, accompanied by a small loss of tree reconstruction accuracy. A method of Bayesian inference from k-mers did not improve on classical alignment-free (and distance-based) methods but may still offer other advantages due to its Bayesian nature. We found the optimal word length k of word-based methods to be stable across various data sets, and we provide parameter ranges for two different alphabets. The influence of these alphabets was analyzed to reveal a trade-off in reconstruction accuracy between long and short branches. We have mapped the phylogenetic accuracy for many alignment-free methods, among them several recently introduced ones, and increased our understanding of their behavior in response to biologically important parameters. In all experiments, the pattern-based approach emerged as superior, at the expense of higher resource consumption. Nonetheless, no alignment-free method that we examined recovers the correct phylogeny as accurately as does an approach based on maximum-likelihood distance estimates of multiply aligned sequences.","evolutionary"

As such, the peptide has a heptad sequence repeat, abcdefg, with isoleucine and leucine residues at the a and d sites to ensure dimerization. In addition, to direct staggered assembly of peptides and to foster fibrillogenesisthat is, as opposed to blunt-ended discrete speciesthe terminal quarters of the peptide are cationic and the central half anionic with lysine and glutamate, respectively, at core-flanking e and g positions. This +,−,−,+ arrangement gives the peptide its name, MagicWand (MW). As judged by circular dichroism (CD) spectra, MW assembles to α-helical structures in the sub-micromolar range and above. The thermal unfolding of MW is reversible with a melting temperature >70 °C at 100 μM peptide concentration. Negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of MW assemblies reveals stiff, straight, fibrous rods that extended for tens of microns. Moreover, different stains highlight considerable order both perpendicular and parallel to the fiber long axis. The dimensions of these features are consistent with bundles of long, straight coiled α-helical coiled coils with their axes aligned parallel to the long axis of the fibers. The fiber thickening indicates inter-coiled-coil interactions. Mutagenesis of the outer surface of the peptidei.e., at the b and f positionscombined with stability and microscopy measurements, highlights the role of electrostatic and cation−π interactions in driving fiber formation, stability and thickening. These findings are discussed in the context of the growing number of self-assembling peptide-based fibrous systems.","biochemistry"
"Three ferroquine (FQ) derivatives, closely mimicking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been prepared. Whereas these organometallic compounds provide the expected reduced cytotoxic effects compared to FQ, they inhibit in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum far better than chloroquine (CQ). Moreover, this new class of bioorganometallic compounds exert antiviral effects with some selectivity toward SARS−CoV infection. These new drugs may offer an interesting alternative for Asia where SARS originated and malaria has remained endemic.","chemistry"
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia are closely correlated in the critically ill patient. Whereas ARDS is often complicated by nosocomial pneumonia, pulmonary infection is also the most frequent single cause of ARDS. The prevalence of pneumonia during the course of ARDS seems to be particularly high, but whether persons with ARDS are more susceptible to pneumonia or simply have more risk factors remains unknown because of methodological limitations. Recent research suggests that host factors have a major bearing on the development of ARDS. To date, sepsis seems to be the principal link between pneumonia and ARDS. However, prospective observational data on this supposed sequence are not available. The individual role of specific pathogens for the development of ARDS is difficult to assess, because prospective studies are missing. Respiratory viruses have received particular attention, but this review suggests that infections with coronavirus and avian influenza virus (H5N1) are associated with a high incidence of ARDS.","microbiology"
"Summary.  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus that infects the liver as primary target. Currently, a high affinity receptor for HBV is still unknown. The dendritic cell specific C‐type lectin DC‐SIGN is involved in pathogen recognition through mannose and fucose containing carbohydrates leading to the induction of an anti‐viral immune response. Many glycosylated viruses subvert this immune surveillance function and exploit DC‐SIGN as a port of entry and for trans‐infection of target cells. The glycosylation pattern on HBV surface antigens (HBsAg) together with the tissue distribution of HBV would allow interaction between HBV and DC‐SIGN and its liver‐expressed homologue L‐SIGN. Therefore, a detailed study to investigate the binding of HBV to DC‐SIGN and L‐SIGN was performed. For HCV, both DC‐SIGN and L‐SIGN are known to bind envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. Soluble DC‐SIGN and L‐SIGN specifically bound HCV virus‐like particles, but no interaction with either HBsAg or HepG2.2.15‐derived HBV was detected. Also, neither DC‐SIGN nor L‐SIGN transfected Raji cells bound HBsAg. In contrast, highly mannosylated HBV, obtained by treating HBV producing HepG2.2.15 cells with the α‐mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine, is recognized by DC‐SIGN. The α‐mannosidase I trimming of N‐linked oligosaccharide structures thus prevents recognition by DC‐SIGN. On the basis of these findings, it is tempting to speculate that HBV exploits mannose trimming as a way to escape recognition by DC‐SIGN and thereby subvert a possible immune activation response.","virology"
"Understanding viral factors that promote cross-species transmission is important for evaluating the risk of zoonotic emergence. Weconstructed a database of viruses of domestic artiodactyls and examined the correlation between traits linked in the literature to cross-species transmission and the ability of viruses to infect humans. Among these traits-genomic material, genome segmentation, and replication without nuclear entry-the last is the strongest predictor of cross-species transmission. This finding highlights nuclear entry as a barrier to transmission and suggests that the ability to complete replication in the cytoplasm may prove to be a useful indicator of the threat of cross-species transmission.","microbiology"
"Bats are natural reservoirs of several important emerging viruses. Cross‐species transmission appears to be quite common among bats, which may contribute to their unique reservoir potential. Therefore, understanding the importance of bats as reservoirs requires examining them in a community context rather than concentrating on individual species. Here, we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross‐species virus transmission in bats and rodents, another important host group. We show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network, suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species. We identify host traits associated with important reservoir species: gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network. We identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence.","ecology"
"High throughput assays for anti‐SARS‐CoV IgG antibody detection are need for large‐scale epidemiologic studies. The performance of a microplate enzyme immunoassay, DETECT‐SARS™, was evaluated for the detection of anti‐SARS‐CoV IgG antibody. This assay is based on synthetic peptides derived from the nucleocapsid and spike proteins. The results showed that the assay provided a high degree of sensitivity (95.9%) for convalescent serum samples. The level of specificity was close to 90%, and did not show significant variation among different control groups. The high degree of sensitivity together with the high‐throughput nature makes it advantageous as a screening assay for studies where handling of a large number of specimens is required. J. Med.

"A high throughput accurate assay for anti‐SARS‐CoV IgG detection is needed for large‐scale epidemiological studies. The evaluation of a commercial recombinant nucleocapsid protein‐based microtitre plate enzyme immunoassay, ELISARS™ is described. The results on 150 sera from SARS patients and 450 sera from non‐SARS controls showed that this assay had a high level of sensitivity (96.2% for late serum samples) and specificity (97.8%). The performance and setup of this assay fulfills the requirement as a screening test for large‐scale studies. A vast majority of SARS patients developed antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein. In some patients (10/45), a high level of anti‐nucleocapsid antibody appeared very early in the course of the illness. In contrast, a minority (4 of 105 patients) never developed these antibodies. The implication of differences in antibody response to the nucleocapsid protein deserves further investigation. J. Med. Virol. 75:181–184, 2005. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"The coronavirus replicase gene encodes one or two papain‐like proteases (termed PL1pro and PL2pro) implicated in the N‐terminal processing of the replicase polyprotein and thus contributing to the formation of the viral replicase complex that mediates genome replication. Using consensus fold recognition with the 3D‐JURY meta‐predictor followed by model building and refinement, we developed a structural model for the single PLpro present in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) genome, based on significant structural relationships to the catalytic core domain of HAUSP, a ubiquitin‐specific protease (USP). By combining the SCoV PLpro model with comparative sequence analyses we show that all currently known coronaviral PLpros can be classified into two groups according to their binding site architectures. One group includes all PL2pros and some of the PL1pros, which are characterized by a restricted USP‐like binding site. This group is designated the R‐group. The remaining PL1pros from some of the coronaviruses form the other group, featuring a more open papain‐like binding site, and is referred to as the O‐group. This two‐group, binding site‐based classification is consistent with experimental data accumulated to date for the specificity of PLpro‐mediated polyprotein processing and PLpro inhibition. It also provides an independent evaluation of the similarity‐based annotation of PLpro‐mediated cleavage sites, as well as a basis for comparison with previous groupings based on phylogenetic analyses.

"Particular guanine rich nucleic acid sequences can fold into stable secondary structures called G-quadruplexes. These structures have been identified in various regions of the genome that include the telomeres, gene promoters and UTR regions, raising the possibility that they may be associated with biological function(s). Computational analysis has predicted that intramolecular G-quadruplex forming sequences are prevalent in the human genome, thus raising the desire to differentially recognize genomic G-quadruplexes. We have employed antibody phage display and competitive selection techniques to generate a single-chain antibody that shows >1000-fold discrimination between G-quadruplex and duplex DNA, and furthermore >100-fold discrimination between two related intramolecular parallel DNA G-quadruplexes. The amino acid sequence composition at the antigen binding site shows conservation within the light and heavy chains of the selected scFvs, suggesting sequence requirements for G-quadruplex recognition. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic data showed that the scFv binds to the prefolded G-quadruplex and does not induce G-quadruplex structure formation. This study demonstrates the strongest discrimination that we are aware of between two intramolecular genomic G-quadruplexes.","biochemistry"
"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a phytopathogenic fungus capable of causing significant yield losses in numerous crops, including canola, in which the fungus causes sclerotinia stem rot. Immunological detection methods to rapidly determine the presence of S. sclerotiorum on plants may provide growers with a viable diagnostic tool to aid with fungicide use decisions. This paper discusses the generation of a monomeric and dimeric single-chain, variable fragment (scFv) antibody with affinity for S. sclerotiorum using phage display technology. The bacterially expressed and purified scFv is shown to bind S. sclerotiorum with some cross-reactivity with the closely related phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea (Pers.:Fr.). The dimeric scFv displayed improved binding to the fungus as compared to the monomer and could detect the presence of mycelia in inoculated canola petals. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of a scFv dimer with affinity for S. sclerotiorum that has the potential for use in the development of a new diagnostic test.","food"
"Peptides from the COOH‐terminal extension of cysteine proteinase B from Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis (cyspep) can modulate immune responses in vertebrate hosts. With this hypothesis as base, we used the online analysis tool SYFPEITHI to predict seven epitopes from this region with potential to bind H2 proteins. We performed proliferation tests and quantified reactive T lymphocytes applying a cytometry analysis, using samples from draining lymph node of lesions from L. (L.) amazonensis‐infected mice. To define reactivity of T cells, we used complexes of DimerX (H2 Db:Ig and H2 Ld:Ig) and the putative epitopes. Additionally, we applied surface plasmon resonance to verify real time interactions between the putative epitopes and DimerX proteins. Five peptides induced blastogenesis in BALB/c cells, while only two presented the same property in C57BL/6 mouse cells. In addition, our data indicate the existence of CD8+ T lymphocyte populations able to recognize each tested peptide in both murine strains. We observed an overlapping of results between the peptides that induced lymphocyte proliferation and those capable of binding to the DimerX in the surface plasmon resonance assays thus indicating that using these recombinant proteins in biosensing analyses is a promising tool to study real time molecular interactions in the context of major histocompatibility complex epitopes. The data gathered in this study reinforce the hypothesis that cyspep‐derived peptides are important factors in the murine host infection by L. (L.) amazonensis.

"Coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein envelops the genomic RNA to form long helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. Since N protein oligomerization is usually a crucial step in this process, characterization of such an oligomerization will help in the understanding of the possible mechanisms for nucleocapsid formation. The N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was recently discovered to self-associate by its carboxyl terminus. In this study, to further address the detailed understanding of the association feature of this C-terminus, its oligomerization was systematically investigated by size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays. Our results clearly indicated that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could form not only dimers but also trimers, tetramers, and hexamers. Further analyses against six deletion mutants showed that residues 343−402 were necessary and sufficient for this C-terminus oligomerization. Although this segment contains many charged residues, differences in ionic strength have no effects on its oligomerization, indicating the absence of electrostatic force in SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus self-association. Gel shift assay results revealed that the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus is also able to associate with nucleic acids and residues 363−382 are the responsible interaction partner, demonstrating that this fragment might involve genomic RNA binding sites. The fact that nucleic acid binding could promote the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus to form high-order oligomers implies that the oligomeric SARS-CoV N protein probably combines with the viral genomic RNA in triggering long nucleocapsid formation.","biochemistry"
"It is well known that statistics using cumulative data are insensitive to changes. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of fatality rates are of the above type, which may not be able to reflect the latest changes in fatality due to treatment or government policy in a timely fashion. Here, the authors propose an estimate of a real-time fatality rate based on a chain multinomial model with a kernel function. It is more accurate than the WHO estimate in describing fatality, especially earlier in the course of an epidemic. The estimator provides useful information for public health policy makers for understanding the severity of the disease or evaluating the effects of treatments or policies within a shorter time period, which is critical in disease control during an outbreak. Simulation results showed that the performance of the proposed estimator is superior to that of the WHO estimator in terms of its sensitivity to changes and its timeliness in reflecting the severity of the disease.","public"

"When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first came to world attention in March 2003, it was immediately perceived to be a global threat with a pandemic potential. To help coordinate international research efforts, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases convened a colloquium entitled SARS: Developing a Research Response on 30 May 2003. Breakout sessions intended to identify unmet research needs in 5 areas of SARS research—clinical research, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines—are summarized here. Since this meeting, however, the identified research needs have been only partially met. Needs that have yet to be realized include reliable methods for early identification of individuals with SARS, a full description of SARS pathogenesis and immune response, and animal models that faithfully mimic SARS respiratory symptoms. It is also of the utmost importance that the global scientific community enhance mechanisms for international cooperation and planning for SARS research, as well as for other emerging infectious disease threats that are certain to arise in the future.","microbiology"
"Objectives  The research compared rectal and oral treatments with glycyrrhizic acid for trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)‐induced colitis in rats. Methods  Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups: one normal and six with colitis, including TNBS, glycyrrhizic acid (2, 10 and 50 mg/kg, rectally treated and 10 mg/kg, orally treated) and sulfasalazine (positive control, 225 mg/kg rectally treated) groups. Colitis was induced by colonic administration of TNBS in 30% ethanol. Key findings  There were significant pathological changes in colon in TNBS‐treated groups, and rectal glycyrrhizic acid significantly attenuated colitis. Myeloperoxidase, tumour necrosis factor‐α and interleukin‐1β of colon tissue or serum in the rectal glycyrrhizic acid groups were markedly reduced when compared with the TNBS group, and lower than in the orally treated glycyrrhizic acid group. It was further noted that, in vitro, glycyrrhizic acid (up to 100 µg/ml) inhibited interleukin‐6 and elevated interleukin‐10 production in lipopolysaccharide‐activated macrophages, and significantly inhibited proliferation of spleen lymphocytes, suggesting the immunoregulatory function of glycyrrhizic acid. Conclusions  Rectally administered glycyrrhizic acid has significant protective effects against TNBS‐induced colitis in rats, and the rectal route may be a complementary treatment for inflammatory bowel disease.","pharmacology"
"A population of approximately 70 000 rusa deer (Cervus timorensis russa) represents the most important mammal species reared for food on the island of Mauritius, being the main source of red meat for the local population. However, very limited information is available on the circulation of pathogens affecting the productivity and health of this species. To produce baseline data on the circulation of infectious pathogens in rusa deer under production, a serological survey and/or direct pathogen detection for six selected infectious diseases was undertaken in 2007 in a sample of 53% of the herds reared in semi‐free‐ranging conditions in hunting estates. Seropositive results were recorded for Johne's disease with an indirect ELISA test (1.7%, n = 351), heartwater with an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) (95.5%, n = 178) and leptospirosis with a Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) (25.9%, n = 363). Significant associations were found between seroprevalence to some of the leptospiral serogroups detected (Tarassovi, Pomona, Sejroe and Mini) and age of the animals, animal density or location of the estates (being more prevalent in hotter and more humid areas). In addition, Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis were confirmed in two deer carcasses by culture and PCR, respectively. No antibodies against Brucella spp. nor Rift Valley Fever virus were detected with the use of respective indirect ELISA's. The results obtained suggest that the population of rusa deer from Mauritius is exposed to a wide range of pathogens which may affect their productivity. In addition, the results highlight the potential public health risks incurred by deer industry workers and consumers. This survey fills an important gap in knowledge regarding the health of tropical deer meat in Mauritius and justifies the need to implement more regular surveys of selected pathogens in the deer population.","veterinary"
"Three-dimensional pharmacophore models for peptidic and small organic nonpeptidic inhibitors of the human rhinovirus 3C protease were generated in a structure-based as well as in a ligand-based approach, using the software package Catalyst. The inhibitors possess an electrophilic moiety, often a Michael acceptor function, which covalently binds to a cysteine in the active site of the enzyme. Since this process presents the key step for virus inactivation, the creation of a new function in Catalyst was required in order to include this decisive functionality into the pharmacophore models. In the present study we focus on this feature definition process because it presents an innovative strategy to expand the pharmacophore description ability of the Catalyst software to also include covalent bonds between ligand and binding site. The resulting hypotheses were then used for virtual screening of 3D databases in order to verify their quality and to search for structurally diverse, possible new lead substances.","computer"

Of the 17 positive results, 2 identified by our method were not detected by single-round, real-time RT-PCR, which suggests that real-time nested PCR has the potential for increased sensitivity, leading to earlier detection of SARS.","microbiology"
"This study analyzes single factors that affect the prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and establishes a prognosis model by multivariate analysis. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of SARS in 165 clinically confirmed severe cases. Both age and existence of other diseases before SARS were significantly correlated with prognosis (r = 0.506 and r = 0.457, respectively; P < .001). During the acute phase of SARS, lactate dehydrogenase level, degree of hypoxemia, respiratory rate, α-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase isoenzyme—MB, platelet count, and number of involved lobes noted on chest radiographs, and so on, correlated markedly with the prognosis (r = 0.257–0.788; P < .05). The multivariate prognosis regression model was associated with degree of hypoxemia and platelet count. The model was defined by the formula Py=1 = es/(1 + es), where S is [2.490 × degree of hypoxemia]-[0.050 × number of platelets], and it had a high sensitivity (91.67%), specificity (98.33%), and accuracy (96.42%).

"The resurgence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the form of unprecedented and explosive epidemics in India and the Indian Ocean islands after a gap of 32 years is a major public health concern. Currently, there is no specific therapy available to treat CHIKV infection. In the present study, the in vitro prophylactic and therapeutic effects of chloroquine on CHIKV replication in Vero cells were investigated. Inhibitory effects were observed when chloroquine was administered pre‐infection, post‐infection, and concurrent with infection, suggesting that chloroquine has prophylactic and therapeutic potential. The inhibitory effects were confirmed by performing a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), real‐time reverse transcriptase (RT)‐PCR analysis of viral RNA levels, and cell viability assays. Chloroquine diminished CHIKV infection in a dose‐dependent manner, with an effective concentration range of 5–20 µM. Concurrent addition of drug with virus, or treatment of cells prior to infection drastically reduced virus infectivity and viral genome copy number by ≥99.99%. The maximum inhibitory effect of chloroquine was observed within 1–3 hr post‐infection (hpi), and treatment was ineffective once the virus successfully passed through the early stages of infection. The mechanism of inhibition of virus activity by chloroquine involved impaired endosomal‐mediated virus entry during early stages of virus replication, most likely through the prevention of endocytosis and/or endosomal acidification, based on a comparative evaluation using ammonium chloride, a known lysosomotropic agent.

"We present a retrospective analysis of the available articles on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) published since the outbreak of the disease. SARS is a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Originating in Guangdong, Southern China, at the end of 2002, it has spread to regions all over the world, affecting more than 8000 people. With high morbidity and mortality, SARS is an important respiratory disease which may be encountered world-wide. The causative virus was identified by a WHO-led network of laboratories, which identified the genome sequence and developed the first molecular assays for diagnosis. For the respiratory physician, detecting SARS in its earliest stages, identifying pathways of transmission, and implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies are all important. The WHO and the CDC have published helpful definitions of ‘suspected’ and ‘probable’ cases. However, the symptoms of the disease may change, and laboratory tests and definitions are still limited. Even in a situation of no new cases of infection, SARS remains a major respiratory health hazard. As with influenza virus outbreaks, new epidemics may arise at the end of each year.","medicine"
"The assembly of viral proteins into a range of macromolecular complexes of strictly defined architecture is one of Nature's wonders. Unraveling the details of these complex structures and the associated self‐assembly pathways that lead to their efficient and precise construction will play an important role in the development of anti‐viral therapeutics. It will also be important in bio‐nanotechnology where there is a plethora of applications for such well‐defined macromolecular complexes, including cell‐specific drug delivery and as substrates for the formation of novel materials with unique electrical and magnetic properties. Mass spectrometry has the ability not only to measure masses accurately but also to provide vital details regarding the composition and stoichiometry of intact, non‐covalently bound macromolecular complexes under near‐physiological conditions.

"Introduction: Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV‐NL63) is one of four common human respiratory coronaviruses. Despite high incidence, HCoV infections are grossly understudied. We here report a case of HCoV infection in a leukemia patient with fatal ARDS despite successful virus elimination by pegylated interferon‐alpha (PEG‐IFN‐α). Case: The 27‐year‐old female pre‐T‐ALL patient was treated according to the German‐Multicenter Trial for Adult ALL protocol. No relevant infectious complications were seen until day 35 when the neutropenic patient developed fever without any clinical focus. Antibiotic prophylaxis was switched to meropenem. The patient deteriorated rapidly with respiratory failure due to ARDS. Anti‐infectious therapy was escalated to additional linezolid and liposomal amphotericine‐B. BAL revealed a significant viral load of HCoV‐NL63. Based on successful application of PEG‐IFN against the related SARS coronavirus in animal experiments, a single injection of 180 μg PEG‐IFN‐α2b was applied. Despite immediate initiation of treatment and elimination of virus in subsequent tests, the progressive lung failure led to death 7 d after onset of fever with massive lung bleeding as a consequence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Conclusion: This report emphasizes the fatal consequences of common respiratory virus infections in immunocompromised patients. HCoV‐NL63 replication can be reduced by treatment with peg‐IFN if diagnosed early.","hematology"

"Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections cause at least 70% of virus‐related wheezing exacerbations and cold and flu‐like illnesses. They are associated with otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia. Annually, the economic impact of HRV infections costs billions in healthcare and lost productivity. Since 1987, 100 officially recognised HRV serotypes reside in two genetically distinct species; HRV A and HRV B, within the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. Sequencing of their ∼7kb genomes was finalised in 2009. Since 1999, many globally circulating, molecularly‐defined ‘strains’, perhaps equivalent to novel serotypes, have been discovered but remain uncharacterised. Many of these currently unculturable strains have been assigned to a proposed new species, HRV C although confusion exists over the membership of the species. There has not been sufficient sampling to ensure the identification of all strains and no consensus criteria exist to define whether clinical HRV detections are best described as a distinct strain or a closely related variant of a previously identified strain (or serotype). We cannot yet robustly identify patterns in the circulation of newly identified HRVs (niHRVs) or the full range of associated illnesses and more data are required. Many questions arise from this new found diversity: what drives the development of so many distinct viruses compared to other species of RNA viruses? What role does recombination play in generating this diversity? Are there species‐ or strain‐specific circulation patterns and clinical outcomes? Are divergent strains sensitive to existing capsid‐binding antivirals? This update reviews the findings that trigger these and other questions arising during the current cycle of intense rhinovirus discovery. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","virology"
"Cathepsin C, or dipeptidyl peptidase I, is a lysosomal cysteine protease of the papain family that catalyzes the sequential removal of dipeptides from the free N-termini of proteins and peptides. Using the dipeptide substrate Ser-Tyr-AMC, cathepsin C was characterized in both steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic modes. The pH(D) rate profiles for both log kcat/Km and log kcat conformed to bell-shaped curves for which an inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect (sKIE) of 0.71 ± 0.14 for D(kcat/Ka) and a normal sKIE of 2.76 ± 0.03 for Dkcat were obtained. Pre-steady-state kinetics exhibited a single-exponential burst of AMC formation in which the maximal acylation rate (kac = 397 ± 5 s−1) was found to be nearly 30-fold greater than the rate-limiting deacylation rate (kdac = 13.95 ± 0.013 s−1) and turnover number (kcat = 13.92 ± 0.001 s−1). Analysis of pre-steady-state burst kinetics in D2O allowed abstraction of a normal sKIE for the acylation half-reaction that was not observed in steady-state kinetics. Since normal sKIEs were obtained for all measurable acylation steps in the presteady state [Dkac = 1.31 ± 0.04, and the transient kinetic isotope effect at time zero (tKIE0) = 2.3 ± 0.2], the kinetic step(s) contributing to the inverse sKIE of D(kcat/Ka) must occur more rapidly than the experimental time frame of the transient kinetics. Results are consistent with a chemical mechanism in which acylation occurs via a two-step process: the thiolate form of Cys-234, which is enriched in D2O and gives rise to the inverse value of D(kcat/Ka), attacks the substrate to form a tetrahedral intermediate that proceeds to form an acyl−enzyme intermediate during a proton transfer step expressing a normal sKIE. The subsequent deacylation half-reaction is rate-limiting, with proton transfers exhibiting normal sKIEs. Through derivation of 12 equations describing all kinetic parameters and sKIEs for the proposed cathepsin C mechanism, integration of both steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics with sKIEs allowed the provision of at least one self-consistent set of values for all 13 rate constants in this cysteine protease’s chemical mechanism. Simulation of the resulting kinetic profile showed that at steady state ∼80% of the enzyme exists in an active-site cysteine-acylated form in the mechanistic pathway. The chemical and kinetic details deduced from this work provide a potential roadmap to help steer drug discovery efforts for this and other disease-relevant cysteine proteases.","biochemistry"

It was suggested that a carboxylate at position 54 was not essential for the activity. The in vitro assays of the proteolysis revealed that most of Glu54 mutants retained relatively high proteolytic activity. When the Glu54 mutation was combined with the Ser mutation of the Cys139 residue, a nucleophile, only the Asp54 and Gln54 mutations showed proteolytic activity comparable to that of the Ser139 single mutant, suggesting that a hydrogen bond between Glu54 and His30 was critical in the Ser139 background. These results suggested that the mechanism of the proteolysis by the wild-type norovirus 3C-like protease was different from that of typical chymotrypsin-like serine proteases.","biochemistry"
"The SARS coronavirus main proteinase (SARS CoV main proteinase) is required for the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), the virus that causes SARS. One function of the enzyme is to process viral polyproteins. The active form of the SARS CoV main proteinase is a homodimer. In the literature, estimates of the monomer−dimer equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, have varied more than 650000-fold, from <1 nM to more than 200 μM. Because of these discrepancies and because compounds that interfere with activation of the enzyme by dimerization may be potential antiviral agents, we investigated the monomer−dimer equilibrium by three different techniques:  small-angle X-ray scattering, chemical cross-linking, and enzyme kinetics. Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering data from a series of measurements at different SARS CoV main proteinase concentrations yielded KD values of 5.8 ± 0.8 μM (obtained from the entire scattering curve), 6.5 ± 2.2 μM (obtained from the radii of gyration), and 6.8 ± 1.5 μM (obtained from the forward scattering). The KD from chemical cross-linking was 12.7 ± 1.1 μM, and from enzyme kinetics, it was 5.2 ± 0.4 μM. While each of these three techniques can present different, potential limitations, they all yielded similar KD values.","biochemistry"
"Copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are conventionally detected using high-throughput scanning technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, or relatively low-throughput techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.","biochemistry"
"16S rRNA gene is one of the preferred targets for resolving species phylogenesis issues in microbiological-related contexts. However, the identification of single-nucleotide variations capable of distinguishing a sequence among a set of homologous ones can be problematic. Here we present ORMA (Oligonucleotide Retrieving for Molecular Applications), a set of scripts for discriminating positions search and for performing the selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes to be used in molecular applications. Two assays based on Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) are presented. First, a new set of probe pairs on cyanobacteria 16S rRNA sequences of 18 different species was compared to that of a previous study. Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species. ORMA represents a significant improvement from other contexts where enzyme-based techniques have been employed on already known mutations of a single base or on entire subsequences.","biochemistry"
"Abstract  Abstract  Dispersion characteristics of expiratory aerosols were investigated in an enclosure with two different idealized airflow patterns: the ceiling‐return and the unidirectional downward. A multiphase numerical model, which was able to capture the polydispersity and evaporation features of the aerosols, was adopted. Experiments employing optical techniques were conducted in a chamber with downward airflow pattern to measure the dispersion of aerosols. Some of the numerical results were compared with the chamber measurement results. Reasonable agreement was found. Small aerosols (initial size ≤45 μm) had settling times of below 20 s in downward flow but increased to 32–80 s in ceiling‐return flow. Lateral dispersion was limited to around 0.3 m in downward flow, in which only turbulent dispersion was significant. It increased to over 2 m in ceiling‐return flow, which had a combination of both turbulant dispersion and bulk flow transport mechanisms. The significance of aerosol transport by bulk flow was about an order of magnitude stronger than that by turbulent dispersion. However, results also show that aerosols could be dispersed for considerable distances solely by turbulence if they were suspended longer. Large aerosols settled within very short time due to heavy gravitational effects. The results provided new insights in designing proper bed spacing in hospital ward environments.","public"
"Abstract  Abstract  There have been few recent studies demonstrating a definitive association between the transmission of airborne infections and the ventilation of buildings. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and current concerns about the risk of an avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, have made a review of this area timely. We searched the major literature databases between 1960 and 2005, and then screened titles and abstracts, and finally selected 40 original studies based on a set of criteria. We established a review panel comprising medical and engineering experts in the fields of microbiology, medicine, epidemiology, indoor air quality, building ventilation, etc. Most panel members had experience with research into the 2003 SARS epidemic. The panel systematically assessed 40 original studies through both individual assessment and a 2‐day face‐to‐face consensus meeting. Ten of 40 studies reviewed were considered to be conclusive with regard to the association between building ventilation and the transmission of airborne infection. There is strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS. There is insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools, offices, homes and isolation rooms in relation to spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route.","public"
"Abstract  Abstract  Continuous emission of unipolar ions has been shown to improve the performance of respirators and stationary filters challenged with non‐biological particles. In this study, we investigated the ion‐induced enhancement effect while challenging a low‐efficiency heating, ventilation and air‐conditioning (HVAC) filter with viable bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and viruses. The aerosol concentration was measured in real time. Samples were also collected with a bioaerosol sampler for viable microbial analysis. The removal efficiency of the filter was determined, respectively, with and without an ion emitter. The ionization was found to significantly enhance the filter efficiency in removing viable biological particles from the airflow. For example, when challenged with viable bacteria, the filter efficiency increased as much as four‐ to fivefold. For viable fungal spores, the ion‐induced enhancement improved the efficiency by a factor of ∼2. When testing with virus‐carrying liquid droplets, the original removal efficiency provided by the filter was rather low: 9.09 ± 4.84%. While the ion emission increased collection about fourfold, the efficiency did not reach 75–100% observed with bacteria and fungi. These findings, together with our previously published results for non‐biological particles, demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach for reducing aerosol particles in HVAC systems used for indoor air quality control.","public"
"Summary Knowing which populations are most at risk for severe outcomes from an emerging infectious disease is crucial in deciding the optimal allocation of resources during an outbreak response. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is the fraction of cases that die after contracting a disease. The relative CFR is the factor by which the case fatality in one group is greater or less than that in a second group. Incomplete reporting of the number of infected individuals, both recovered and dead, can lead to biased estimates of the CFR. We define conditions under which the CFR and the relative CFR are identifiable. Furthermore, we propose an estimator for the relative CFR that controls for time‐varying reporting rates. We generalize our methods to account for elapsed time between infection and death. To demonstrate the new methodology, we use data from the 1918 influenza pandemic to estimate relative CFRs between counties in Maryland. A simulation study evaluates the performance of the methods in outbreak scenarios. An R software package makes the methods and data presented here freely available. Our work highlights the limitations and challenges associated with estimating absolute and relative CFRs in practice. However, in certain situations, the methods presented here can help identify vulnerable subpopulations early in an outbreak of an emerging pathogen such as pandemic influenza.","statistics"
"The CVTree web server (http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/cvtree) presented here is a new implementation of the whole genome-based, alignment-free composition vector (CV) method for phylogenetic analysis. It is more efficient and user-friendly than the previously published version in the 2004 web server issue of Nucleic Acids Research. The development of whole genome-based alignment-free CV method has provided an independent verification to the traditional phylogenetic analysis based on a single gene or a few genes. This new implementation attempts to meet the challenge of ever increasing amount of genome data and includes in its database more than 850 prokaryotic genomes which will be updated monthly from NCBI, and more than 80 fungal genomes collected manually from several sequencing centers. This new CVTree web server provides a faster and stable research platform. Users can upload their own sequences to find their phylogenetic position among genomes selected from the server's; inbuilt database. All sequence data used in a session may be downloaded as a compressed file. In addition to standard phylogenetic trees, users can also choose to output trees whose monophyletic branches are collapsed to various taxonomic levels. This feature is particularly useful for comparing phylogeny with taxonomy when dealing with thousands of genomes.","biochemistry"
"In order to develop a dose‐response model for SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), the pooled data sets for infection of transgenic mice susceptible to SARS‐CoV and infection of mice with murine hepatitis virus strain 1, which may be a clinically relevant model of SARS, were fit to beta‐Poisson and exponential models with the maximum likelihood method. The exponential model (k= 4.1 × l02) could describe the dose‐response relationship of the pooled data sets. The beta‐Poisson model did not provide a statistically significant improvement in fit. With the exponential model, the infectivity of SARS‐CoV was calculated and compared with those of other coronaviruses. The does of SARS‐CoV corresponding to 10% and 50% responses (illness) were estimated at 43 and 280 PFU, respectively. Its estimated infectivity was comparable to that of HCoV‐229E, known as an agent of human common cold, and also similar to those of some animal coronaviruses belonging to the same genetic group. Moreover, the exponential model was applied to the analysis of the epidemiological data of SARS outbreak that occurred at an apartment complex in Hong Kong in 2003. The estimated dose of SARS‐CoV for apartment residents during the outbreak, which was back‐calculated from the reported number of cases, ranged from 16 to 160 PFU/person, depending on the floor. The exponential model developed here is the sole dose‐response model for SARS‐CoV at the present and would enable us to understand the possibility for reemergence of SARS.","social"
"Background:  The diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in surgical patients can potentially be missed based on current World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions. Method:  We report a retrospective case series of 10 surgical inpatients diagnosed with SARS following an outbreak in the surgical wards. Patients were included if they fulfilled the WHO case definition of probable SARS, had an active surgical problem and were admitted to the surgical wards during the outbreak period. Clinical histories, laboratory investigations and radiological findings were reviewed and analyzed. Results:  The mean age of the cohort was 57.6 years (range: 38−78 years). Nine patients had concomitant medical conditions. Three patients were in the early postoperative period, while the remaining seven were admitted for surgical related infections. All patients presented with fever, but only eight had accompanying respiratory symptoms. Lymphopenia and raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was seen in seven patients. Eight patients had positive bacterial cultures. The primary abnormality on chest radiograph was air‐space opacification. Rapid progression of radiological changes was seen in seven patients. Mortality rate for our cohort is 20%. Conclusion:  The diagnosis of SARS in surgical patients differs from that previously described in normal patients. An apparent cause of fever and positive blood cultures cannot exclude a diagnosis of SARS. The current WHO case definition could result in delayed or even missed diagnosis. Early isolation of febrile patients with a positive contact history must be undertaken, even in the face of another identifiable cause.","surgery"
"The non‐structural protein NS1 of the influenza A virus is a good target for the development of diagnostic assays. In this study, three NS1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated by using recombinant NS1 protein of H5N1 virus and found to bind both the native and denatured forms of NS1. Two of the mAbs, 6A4 and 2H6, bind NS1 of three different strains of influenza A virus, namely H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1. Epitope mapping revealed that residues 42–53 of H5N1 NS1 are essential for the interaction with both mAbs. Between the three strains, there is only one amino acid difference in this domain, which is consistent with the observed cross‐reactivities. On the other hand, mAb 1G1 binds to residues 206–215 of H5N1 NS1 and does not bind NS1 of H1N1 or H3N2. Furthermore, all three mAbs detected NS1 proteins expressed in virus infected MDCK cells and indirect immunofluorescence staining with mAbs 6A4 and 2H6 provided an alternative method for viral titer determination. Quantifying the numbers of fluorescent foci units yielded viral titers for three different isolates of H5N1 virus that are highly comparable to that obtained by observing cytopathic effect induced by virus infection. Importantly, this alternative method yields results at 1 day post‐infection while the conventional method using cytopathic effect yields results at 3 days post‐infection. The results showed that this new panel of NS1 antibodies can detect NS1 protein expressed during viral infection and can be used for fast and easy titration of influenza A virus. J. Med.

"Virtual screening (VS) represents an important tool for the drug discovery process, in particular for the hit generation phase. Classifiers are often inserted as filters at the beginning of a VS path, and in the present paper the performances of several PLS-DA classifiers (QikProp, Dragon, EVA descriptors) are evaluated in the effort to distinguish PDE4 inhibitors from other druglike molecules. As benchmark also docking scores and the fitness to pharmacophore hypotheses were used to perform the same task, checking in this way if docking or 3D search can be anticipated in the VS process. The visual analysis of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was useful to have an overall picture of the classification and to select the right threshold that marks the boundary between active and inactive classes. The best classification was obtained by a model based on the Dragon descriptors that are calculated from the molecular 2D structure. Its performance was good for the training set in terms of recall, enrichment factor, and area under the ROC curve and was confirmed in the prediction of the test set.","computer"

"Although primary genomic analysis has revealed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) is a new type of coronavirus, the different protein trees published in previous reports have provided no conclusive evidence indicating the phylogenetic position of SARS CoV. To clarify the phylogenetic relationship between SARS CoV and other coronaviruses, we compiled a large data set composed of 7 concatenated protein sequences and performed comprehensive analyses, using the maximum-likelihood, Bayesian-inference, and maximum-parsimony methods. All resulting phylogenetic trees displayed an identical topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between SARS CoV and group 2 CoVs is monophyletic. Relationships among all major groups were well resolved and were supported by all statistical analyses.","microbiology"
"Infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics such as those due to SARS, influenza, measles, tuberculosis, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus have raised concern about the airborne transmission of pathogens in indoor environments. Significant gaps in knowledge still exist regarding the role of mechanical ventilation in airborne pathogen transmission. This review, prepared by a multidisciplinary group of researchers, focuses on summarizing the strengths and limitations of epidemiologic studies that specifically addressed the association of at least one heating, ventilating and/or air‐conditioning (HVAC) system‐related parameter with airborne disease transmission in buildings. The purpose of this literature review was to assess the quality and quantity of available data and to identify research needs. This review suggests that there is a need for well‐designed observational and intervention studies in buildings with better HVAC system characterization and measurements of both airborne exposures and disease outcomes. Studies should also be designed so that they may be used in future quantitative meta‐analyses.","public"
"The concept of using plants to produce high‐value pharmaceuticals such as vaccines is 20 years old this year and is only now on the brink of realisation as an established technology. The original reliance on transgenic plants has largely given way to transient expression; proofs of concept for human and animal vaccines and of efficacy for animal vaccines have been established; several plant‐produced vaccines have been through Phase I clinical trials in humans and more are scheduled; regulatory requirements are more clear than ever, and more facilities exist for manufacture of clinic‐grade materials. The original concept of cheap edible vaccines has given way to a realisation that formulated products are required, which may well be injectable. The technology has proven its worth as a means of cheap, easily scalable production of materials: it now needs to find its niche in competition with established technologies. The realised achievements in the field as well as promising new developments will be reviewed, such as rapid‐response vaccines for emerging viruses with pandemic potential and bioterror agents.","plant"
"Human astroviruses (HAstVs) have been recognized as one of the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in children. To provide more insight into the prevalence of HAstV gastroenteritis in China, 664 fecal samples were collected from children affected with acute gastroenteritis in Beijing from March 2005 to November 2007. The samples were analyzed genetically. All eight serotypes (genotypes) of HAstVs were screened using RT‐PCR assays targeting the ORF2 region in the study. The assays detected HAstVs in 52 (7.8%) of the patients, with HAstV‐1 (50/52) being the dominant genotype during the study period. Two minor genotypes, HAstV‐6 and HAstV‐3, were also detected. Partial sequencing of the 50 HAstV‐1 strains showed that the homology of the nucleotide sequence of the ORF1a region between these strains was 88.4–100%, whereas the homology of the amino acid sequences was 95.6–100%. In the ORF2 partial region, the nucleotide identities ranged from 91.5% to 100%, and amino acid identities ranged from 97.3% to 100%. The identity of the whole genome sequence between four randomly examined HAstV‐1 strains was 91–99%. No recombination events were observed in HAstVs in this study.

"The live replication‐competent modified vaccinia virus Tiantan (MVTT) is an attractive vaccine vector, yet little is known about its tissue tropism and pathology in vivo. Recently, we demonstrated that a recombinant MVTT expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS‐CoV (namely MVTT‐S) is superior to the non‐replicating modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA‐S) for inducing high level of neutralizing antibodies through mucosal vaccination. In this study, we further determined the tissue tropism and safety of MVTT‐S after the vaccine was administrated through various routes including: intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), and intravaginal (i.vag.) inoculations, respectively. Using real‐time PCR, nested PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays, we found that MVTT‐S was able to produce a transient infection in all cases within 48 hr post‐inoculation, yet the major site of viral replication in various tissues or organs was dependent on the route of viral administration. We demonstrated that i.m. injection of MVTT‐S primarily targeted draining inguinal lymph nodes, whereas mucosal inoculation had broader range of tissue infections. i.n. inoculation involved infections in lungs, kidneys, spleens and cervix lymph nodes while i.vag. administration targeted uteruses, ovaries, kidneys and spleens. Critically, the infection did not cause severe pathogenic consequences in infected tissues, which was consistent to the attenuated phenotype of MVTT‐S. Our findings have implications for the optimization of vaccination route and for studies on the correlation between the magnitude of immune responses and the extent of tissue involvement in vivo. J.

"Protein characterization plays a role in two key aspects of structural proteomics. The first is the quality assessment of the produced protein preparations. Obtaining well diffracting crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the structure‐determination pipeline. Often, this is caused by the poor quality of the protein preparation used for crystallization trials. Hence, it is essential to perform an extensive quality assessment of the protein preparations prior to crystallization and to use the results in the evaluation of the process. Here, a protein‐production and crystallization strategy is proposed with threshold values for protein purity (95%) and monodispersity (85%) below which a further optimization of the protein‐production process is strongly recommended. The second aspect is the determination of protein characteristics such as domains, oligomeric state, post‐translational modifications and protein–protein and protein–ligand interactions. In this paper, applications and new developments of protein‐characterization methods using MS, fluorescence spectroscopy, static light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small‐angle X‐ray scattering within the EC Structural Proteomics in Europe contract are described.

"An asymptomatic case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred early in 2004, during a community outbreak of SARS in Guangzhou, China. This was the first time that a case of asymptomatic SARS was noted in an individual with antigenemia and seroconversion. The asymptomatic case patient and the second index case patient with SARS in the 2003–2004 outbreak both worked in the same restaurant, where they served palm civets, which were found to carry SARS-associated coronaviruses. Epidemiological information and laboratory findings suggested that the findings for the patient with asymptomatic infection, together with the findings from previously reported serological analyses of handlers of wild animals and the 4 index case patients from the 2004 community outbreak, reflected a likely intermediate phase of animal-to-human transmission of infection, rather than a case of human-to-human transmission. This intermediate phase may be a critical stage for virus evolution and disease prevention.","microbiology"

SARS-CoV was detected in lung (100%), bowel (73%), liver (41%), and kidney (38%) in 19 patients who died of SARS, with the highest viral loads observed in lung (1.0 × 1010 copies/g) and bowel (2.7 × 109 copies/g).

"Abstract  Abstract  A large number of infectious diseases are believed to be transmitted between people via large droplets and by airborne routes. An understanding of evaporation and dispersion of droplets and droplet nuclei is not only significant for developing effective engineering control methods for infectious diseases but also for exploring the basic transmission mechanisms of the infectious diseases. How far droplets can move is related to how far droplet‐borne diseases can transmit. A simple physical model is developed and used here to investigate the evaporation and movement of droplets expelled during respiratory activities; in particular, the well‐known Wells evaporation–falling curve of droplets is revisited considering the effect of relative humidity, air speed, and respiratory jets. Our simple model considers the movement of exhaled air, as well as the evaporation and movement of a single droplet. Exhaled air is treated as a steady‐state non‐isothermal (warm) jet horizontally issuing into stagnant surrounding air. A droplet is assumed to evaporate and move in this non‐isothermal jet. Calculations are performed for both pure water droplets and droplets of sodium chloride (physiological saline) solution (0.9% w/v). We calculate the droplet lifetimes and how droplet size changes, as well as how far the droplets travel in different relative humidities. Our results indicate that a droplet's size predominately dictates its evaporation and movement after being expelled. The sizes of the largest droplets that would totally evaporate before falling 2 m away are determined under different conditions. The maximum horizontal distances that droplets can reach during different respiratory activities are also obtained. Our study is useful for developing effective prevention measures for controlling infectious diseases in hospitals and in the community at large.","public"

"Influenza A and B viruses cause serious medical problems and social disruption every year in particular countries of the world. The virus is notoriously fickle and may attack citizens in say two adjacent countries but not the third. More rarely a global pandemic virus emerges causing millions of deaths worldwide. The SARS outbreak has illuminated weaknesses in planning for sudden outbreaks of disease in a modern society and in particular how panic can grip and cause intense economic disruption. Many communities in the world are neither prepared for a global pandemic nor a very acute epidemic of influenza. The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are a new class of antiviral drug targeting a viral influenza enzyme, the neuraminidase, which acts both to facilitate virus infection of cells by clearing a passage through otherwise protective respiratory fluids and also by helping release of the virus by cutting the chemical umbilical cord which links up the virus to the infected cell. Extensive laboratory studies of the two molecules zanamivir and oseltamivir have shown that they block all influenza A and B viruses yet tested and would, in theory, even inhibit the 1918 pandemic virus. Both drugs can be used prophylactically to prevent spread of infection in families and communities where 80–90% protection has been documented. The therapeutic effects are also strong in adults and children abbreviating infection, reducing quantities of excreted virus and reducing antibiotic prescriptions. The drugs have to be taken within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. Drug resistance is not a problem at present because although such mutants occur the mutants are compromised and are less virulent than their drug-sensitive parents and they spread less easily. The two drugs could be stockpiled to prepare for an influenza pandemic but, importantly, clinical and scientific experience need to be gained by using these inhibitors in the yearly conflagrations of epidemic influenza, which unchecked do great harm to our communities.","pharmacology"
"Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting viral or cellular genes can effectively inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. This inhibition, however, may induce mutations in the targeted gene, leading to rapid escape from the shRNA-induced inhibition. We generated a lymphoid cell line that stably expressed a 19-bp shRNA targeting a well-conserved dimerization initiation site (DIS) of HIV-1, which strongly inhibited viral replication, thereby delaying virus escape. Furthermore, treatment of HIV-1 infection with DIS- and vif-shRNA combination therapy resulted in superior anti-viral responses compared to vif-shRNA monotherapy. Continuous challenge with HIV-1, however, generated virus mutants that could overcome the RNA interference restriction. Such anti-genes may be promising tools for HIV-1 gene therapy for HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.","biochemistry"

IgG antibody and NAb titers were highly correlated, peaking at month 4 after the onset of disease and decreasing thereafter. IgG antibodies remained detectable in all patients until month 16, and they became undetectable in 11.8% of patients at month 24. The finding that NAbs remained detectable throughout follow-up is reassuring in terms of protection provided against reinfection; however, NAb titers decreased markedly after month 16","microbiology"

"Background. Health care workers continued to contract severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), even after barrier precautions were widely implemented. Methods. We explored the possible contribution of contaminated hospital surfaces to SARS transmission by swabbing surfaces in 2 hospitals and testing the swab samples by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture. Results. Twenty-six of 94 swab samples tested positive for viral RNA. Swab samples of respiratory secretions from each of the 4 patients examined tested positive by RT-PCR, as were 12 of 43 swabs from patient rooms and 10 of 47 swabs from other parts of the hospital, including the computer mouses at 2 nursing stations and the handrail of the public elevator. Specimens from areas with patients with SARS in the most infectious phase of illness (days 5–15 after onset) were more likely to be RNA positive than were swab specimens from elsewhere (24 of 63 samples vs. 2 of 31 samples; P = .001). All cultures showed no growth. Conclusions. Although the viruses identified may have been noninfectious, health care workers should be aware that SARS coronavirus can contaminate environmental surfaces in the hospital, and fomites should be considered to be a possible mode of transmission of SARS.","microbiology"
"Studies of gene fusions in solid tumors are not as extensive as in hematological malignancies due to several technical and analytical problems associated with tumor heterogeneity. Nevertheless, there is a growing interest in the role of fusion genes in common epithelial tumors after the discovery of recurrent TMPRSS2:ETS fusions in prostate cancer. Among all of the reported fusion partners in the ETS gene family, TMPRSS2:ERG is the most prevalent one. Here, we present a simple and sensitive microarray-based assay that is able to simultaneously determine multiple fusion variants with a single RT–PCR in impure RNA specimens. The assay detected TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts with a detection sensitivity of <10 cells in the presence of more than 3000 times excess normal RNA, and in primary prostate tumors having no >1% of cancer cells. The ability to detect multiple transcript variants in a single assay is critically dependent on both the primer and probe designs. The assay should facilitate clinical and basic studies for fusion gene screening in clinical specimens, as it can be readily adapted to include multiple gene loci.","biochemistry"
"Objectives: To evaluate the ability of a high‐cell‐passage canine coronavirus vaccine to immunise dogs against challenge with a field isolate of the virus. Methods: Three dogs that had previously tested seronegative and virus‐negative for canine coronavirus were inoculated twice, at 21‐day intervals, with the vaccine and kept under observation. Two seronegative and virus‐negative dogs served as unvaccinated controls. For safety tests, two additional dogs were inoculated oronasally with 10 times the vaccinal dose and no reactions were observed. Faecal samples were collected daily from the vaccinated dogs after the first and second inoculations. Both vaccinated and control dogs were challenged two weeks after the second vaccination with a field canine coronavirus strain. Blood samples were collected for serological tests before vaccination and at weekly intervals after vaccinations and challenge. Results: Virus was not detected in faecal samples after the first or second vaccinations by virus isolation assays and PCR. Significantly, the vaccinated dogs did not have clinical signs after challenge and no virus shedding was observed. The two unvaccinated control dogs had moderate enteritis, and virus was detected in cell cultures starting from three days postchallenge (dog 1) and two days postchallenge (dog 2), and by PCR for 23 median days. Clinical Significance: This study showed the efficacy of a high‐cell‐passage canine coronavirus vaccine in preventing infection of dogs by virulent virus and, specifically, its ability to induce sterilising immunity.","veterinary"
"Aims This study examined the functional role of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET)-mediated cardioprotection in mice with targeted disruption of the sEH or Ephx2 gene (sEH null). Methods and results Isolated mouse hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode and subjected to global no-flow ischaemia followed by reperfusion. Hearts were analysed for recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), mRNA levels, and protein expression. Naïve hearts from sEH null mice had similar expression of preproBNP (Nppb) mRNA compared with wild-type (WT) hearts. However, significant increases in Nppb mRNA and BNP protein expression occurred during post-ischaemic reperfusion and correlated with improved post-ischaemic recovery of LVDP. Perfusion with the putative EET receptor antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid prior to ischaemia reduced the preproBNP mRNA in sEH null hearts. Inhibitor studies demonstrated that perfusion with the natriuretic peptide receptor type-A (NPR-A) antagonist, A71915, limited the improved recovery in recombinant full-length mouse BNP (rBNP)- and 11,12-EET-perfused hearts as well as in sEH null mice. Increased expression of phosphorylated protein kinase C ε and Akt were found in WT hearts perfused with either 11,12-EET or rBNP, while mitochondrial glycogen synthase kinase-3β was significantly lower in the same samples. Furthermore, treatment with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin abolished improved LVDP recovery in 11,12-EET-treated hearts but not did significantly inhibit recovery of rBNP-treated hearts. Conclusion Taken together, these data indicate that EET-mediated cardioprotection involves BNP and PI3K signalling events.","cardiac"
"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged with highly contagious and life-threatening characteristics in 2002, remains a potential risk for future outbreaks. Membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins are major structural proteins of the SARS-CoV. The M protein has been determined as a protective antigen in humoral responses. However, its potential roles in stimulating cellular immunity remain elusive. Methods. In this study, a panel of peptides derived from M and E proteins were tested by in vitro refolding, T2 cell-binding assays, and responses stimulated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results. A nonameric epitope Mn2 and a decameric epitope Md3 derived from the M protein were identified and used for the evaluation of M protein-specific immunity. Responses stimulated by M protein-specific CTL epitopes have been found in the PBMCs of donors who had recovered from SARS infection. Additionally, the transmembrane domain of the M protein may contain a T cell epitope cluster revealed by the immunogenic and structural analysis of a panel of truncated peptides overlapping with Mn2 and Md3. Conclusions. The M protein of SARS-CoV holds dominant cellular immunogenicity. This, together with previous reports of a strong humoral response against the M protein, may help to further explain the immunogenicity of SARS and serves as potential targets for SARS-CoV vaccine design.","microbiology"
"Phosphatidylinositol 4‐kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) is a host factor required for genome RNA replication of enteroviruses, small non‐enveloped viruses belonging to the family Picornaviridae. Here, we demonstrated that PI4KB is also essential for genome replication of another picornavirus, Aichi virus (AiV), but is recruited to the genome replication sites by a different strategy from that utilized by enteroviruses. AiV non‐structural proteins, 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB, interacted with a Golgi protein, acyl‐coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3). Furthermore, we identified previously unknown interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB, which provides a novel manner of Golgi recruitment of PI4KB. Knockdown of ACBD3 or PI4KB suppressed AiV RNA replication. The viral proteins, ACBD3, PI4KB, and phophatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate (PI4P) localized to the viral RNA replication sites. AiV replication and recruitment of PI4KB to the RNA replication sites were not affected by brefeldin A, in contrast to those in enterovirus infection. These results indicate that a viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed to synthesize PI4P at the AiV RNA replication sites and plays an essential role in viral RNA replication.","cell"
"The -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifts (PRF), which are used by many viruses, occur at a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and are currently thought to involve the tRNAs interacting with the ribosomal P- and A-site codons. We investigated here whether the tRNA occupying the ribosomal E site that precedes a slippery site influences -1 PRF. Using the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) frameshift region, we found that mutating the E-site codon altered the -1 PRF efficiency. When the HIV-1 slippery sequence was replaced with other viral slippery sequences, mutating the E-site codon also altered the -1 PRF efficiency. Because HIV-1 -1 PRF can be recapitulated in bacteria, we used a bacterial ribosome system to select, by random mutagenesis, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) mutations that modify the expression of a reporter requiring HIV-1 -1 PRF. Three mutants were isolated, which are located in helices 21 and 22 of 16S rRNA, a region involved in translocation and E-site tRNA binding. We propose a novel model where -1 PRF is triggered by an incomplete translocation and depends not only on the tRNAs interacting with the P- and A-site codons, but also on the tRNA occupying the E site.","biochemistry"
"HCoV‐NL63, the fourth human coronavirus, has been isolated recently from children with respiratory tract infections, including upper respiratory infection, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. The virus has been also detected in immunocompromised adults with respiratory tract infections. A total of 118 nasopharyngeal swab samples from 118 hospitalized young children aged less than 2 years with bronchiolitis who were not infected with human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A or B, or human metaneumovirus were selected. Three (2.5%) of the 118 samples were positive for HCoV‐NL63 by reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction tests. HCoV‐NL63 may be one of the causative agents of bronchiolitis in young children.

"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory pathogen. We tested respiratory specimens for the presence of hMPV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. These specimens were obtained over a 1-year period from children aged <5 years and had negative results by the direct fluorescent antibody test for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1–3, and adenovirus. Overall, 54 (8.1%) of 668 individuals tested positive for hMPV. During March and April of the study period, hMPV was detected in 17.6% and 25.0% of specimens tested, respectively. At least 2 distinct genotypes of hMPV circulated during the study period. Fever, tachypnea, cough, rhinorrhea, retractions of the chest wall, and wheezing were common findings. Of hMPV-positive children, 60.4% were aged <12 months. hMPV accounted for a small but significant proportion of respiratory-tract disease in infants and children.","microbiology"
"Pulmonary infections in critically ill patients are common and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Piperacillin–tazobactam is a frequently used therapy in critically ill patients with pulmonary infection. Antibiotic concentrations in the lung reflect target‐site antibiotic concentrations in patients with pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the plasma and intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of piperacillin–tazobactam in critically ill patients administered standard piperacillin–tazobactam regimens. A population PK model was developed to describe plasma and intrapulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations. The probability of piperacillin exposures reaching pharmacodynamic end points and the impact of pulmonary permeability on piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration was explored. The median piperacillin and tazobactam pulmonary penetration ratios were 49.3 and 121.2%, respectively. Pulmonary piperacillin and tazobactam concentrations were unpredictable and negatively correlated with pulmonary permeability. Current piperacillin–tazobactam regimens may be insufficient to treat pneumonia caused by piperacillin–tazobactam–susceptible organisms in some critically ill patients.

"Aberrant expression of DNA polymerase β, a key enzyme involved in base excision repair, leads to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Pol β expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3′UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3′UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element—the anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA–protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol β mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol β.","biochemistry"
"A purification protocol is described herein for concurrent isolation of two defense proteins including a 6‐kDa defensin‐like antifungal peptide and a 60‐kDa dimeric hemagglutinin from seeds of the French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). It involved ion‐exchange chromatography on SP‐Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi‐gel blue gel, ion‐exchange chromatography on Q‐Sepharose, and gel filtration on Superdex Peptide (for defensin‐like antifungal peptide) or Superdex 200 (for hemagglutinin). Both antifungal and hemagglutinating activities were adsorbed on SP‐Sepharose and then on Affi‐gel blue gel. Hemagglutinin was subsequently unadsorbed and defensin‐like antifungal peptide adsorbed on Q‐Sepharose. The antifungal activity of the antifungal peptide was stable in the temperature range of 0–90 °C for 20 min, in the pH range of 4–10, and after exposure to trypsin (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. The hemagglutinin was stable from 10 to 80 °C, from pH 1 to 12, and after treatment with trypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. It inhibited [methyl‐3H]thymidine incorporation into breast cancer (MCF‐7), leukemia (L1210), hepatoma (HepG2) and human embryonic liver (WRL68) cells with an IC50 of 6.6, 7, 13 and 15 µM, respectively, and elicited maximal mitogenic response from mouse splenocytes at 1 µM concentration.

"Objectives:  Before the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), use of the powered air‐purifying respirator (PAPR) in the setting of pulmonary tuberculosis has been controversial. Data regarding health care worker (HCW) perceptions and problems encountered with the use of the PAPRs were lacking. Methodology:  A questionnaire‐based survey was conducted of HCWs who had used the PAPR in clinical practice during the SARS outbreak, when use of the PAPR was mandatory and widespread. Evaluations of the question of whether HCWs were receptive to the use of the PAPR and their perceptions of common problems that were encountered were made. Perceptions of comfort, ease of use, visual, hearing, breathing and speech impairment, perceived protection against SARS and usage preferences were recorded. Results:  Only a minority of respondents found the PAPR uncomfortable, despite some interference with communication. Despite its much higher cost, the majority (84%) preferred to use the PAPR rather than the N‐95 respirator when treating suspected SARS patients. However, opinions were equally divided regarding its use when treating patients with pulmonary tuberculosis; with 51% being in favour. Conclusions:  With the advent of highly contagious diseases that pose a major occupational hazard to HCWs, the use of the PAPR has become more acceptable in clinical practice.","respiratory"

"During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore from 1 March to 11 May 2003, various national prevention and control measures were undertaken to control and eliminate the transmission of the infection. During the initial period of the epidemic, public communication was effected through press releases and media coverage of the epidemic. About a month into the epidemic, a public education campaign was mounted to educate Singaporeans on SARS and adoption of appropriate behaviours to prevent the spread of the disease. A survey was conducted in late April 2003 to assess Singaporeans' knowledge about SARS and infection control measures, and their concerns and anxiety in relation to the outbreak. The survey also sought to assess their confidence in the ability of various institutions to deal with SARS and their opinion on the seemingly tough measures enforced. The study involved 853 adults selected from a telephone-sampling frame. Stratified sampling was used to ensure adequate representation from major ethnic groups and age groups. The study showed that the overall knowledge about SARS and control measures undertaken was low (mean per cent score of 24.5 ± 8.9%). While 82% of respondents expressed confidence in measures undertaken by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (the hospital designated to manage SARS), only 36% had confidence in nursing homes. However, >80% of the public agreed that the preventive and control measures instituted were appropriate. Despite the low knowledge score, the overall mean satisfaction score of the government's response to SARS was 4.47 (out of possible highest score of 5.00), with >93% of adult Singaporeans indicating that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the government's response to SARS. Generally, Singaporeans had a high level of public trust (satisfaction with government, confidence in institutions, deeming government measures appropriate), scoring 11.4 out of possible maximum of 14. The disparity between low knowledge on the one hand and high confidence and trust in the actions of the government on the other suggests that Singaporeans do not require high knowledge sufficiency to be confident in measures undertaken by the government to control the SARS crisis.","public"
"Despite the fact that most emerging diseases stem from the transmission of pathogenic agents from animals to humans, the factors that mediate this process are still ill defined. What is known, however, is that the interface between humans and animals is of paramount importance in the process. This review will discuss the importance of the human-animal interface to the disease emergence process. We also provide an overview of factors that are believed to contribute to the origin and global spread of emerging infectious diseases and offer suggestions that may serve as future prevention strategies, such as social mobilization, public health education, behavioral change, and communication strategies. Because there exists no comprehensive global surveillance system to monitor zoonotic disease emergence, the intervention measures discussed herein may prove effective temporary alternatives.","microbiology"
"Motivation: Regulatory proteases modulate proteomic dynamics with a spectrum of specificities against substrate proteins. Predictions of the substrate sites in a proteome for the proteases would facilitate understanding the biological functions of the proteases. High-throughput experiments could generate suitable datasets for machine learning to grasp complex relationships between the substrate sequences and the enzymatic specificities. But the capability in predicting protease substrate sites by integrating the machine learning algorithms with the experimental methodology has yet to be demonstrated. Results: Factor Xa, a key regulatory protease in the blood coagulation system, was used as model system, for which effective substrate site predictors were developed and benchmarked. The predictors were derived from bootstrap aggregation (machine learning) algorithms trained with data obtained from multilevel substrate phage display experiments. The experimental sampling and computational learning on substrate specificities can be generalized to proteases for which the active forms are available for the in vitro experiments.

"Horizontal DNA transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity. Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up ∼6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among ∼12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures. Among the species studied, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus Influenzae and Escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect HTs.","biochemistry"

"Motivation: Although the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is currently over, it is expected that it will return to attack human beings. A critical challenge to scientists from various disciplines worldwide is to study the specificity of cleavage activity of SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and use the knowledge obtained from the study for effective inhibitor design to fight the disease. The most commonly used inductive programming methods for knowledge discovery from data assume that the elements of input patterns are orthogonal to each other. Suppose a sub-sequence is denoted as P2P1P1′P2′, the conventional inductive programming method may result in a rule like ‘if P1 = Q, then the sub-sequence is cleaved, otherwise non-cleaved’. If the site P1 is not orthogonal to the others (for instance, P2, P1′ and P2′), the prediction power of these kind of rules may be limited. Therefore this study is aimed at developing a novel method for constructing non-orthogonal decision trees for mining protease data. Result: Eighteen sequences of coronavirus polyprotein were downloaded from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Among these sequences, 252 cleavage sites were experimentally determined. These sequences were scanned using a sliding window with size k to generate about 50 000 k-mer sub-sequences (for short, k-mers). The value of k varies from 4 to 12 with a gap of two. The bio-basis function proposed by Thomson et al. is used to transform the k-mers to a high-dimensional numerical space on which an inductive programming method is applied for the purpose of deriving a decision tree for decision-making. The process of this transform is referred to as a bio-mapping. The constructed decision trees select about 10 out of 50 000 k-mers. This small set of selected k-mers is regarded as a set of decisive templates. By doing so, non-orthogonal decision trees are constructed using the selected templates and the prediction accuracy is significantly improved.

"The study of viral molecular genetics has produced a considerable body of research into the sequences and phylogenetic relationships of human and animal viruses. A review of this literature suggests that humans have been afflicted by viruses throughout their evolutionary history, although the number and types have changed. Some viruses show evidence of long‐standing intimate relationship and cospeciation with hominids, while others are more recently acquired from other species, including African monkeys and apes while our line was evolving in that continent, and domesticated animals and rodents since the Neolithic. Viral selection for specific resistance polymorphisms is unlikely, but in conjunction with other parasites, viruses have probably contributed to selection pressure maintaining major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity and a strong immune response. They may also have played a role in the loss in our lineage of N‐glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a cell‐surface receptor for many infectious agents. Shared viruses could have affected hominid species diversity both by promoting divergence and by weeding out less resistant host populations, while viruses carried by humans and other animals migrating out of Africa may have contributed to declines in other populations. Endogenous retroviral insertions since the divergence between humans and chimpanzees were capable of directly affecting hominid evolution through changes in gene expression and development.

"We have utilized a de novo designed two‐stranded α‐helical coiled‐coil template to display conserved α‐helical epitopes from the stem region of hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins of influenza A. The immunogens have all the surface‐exposed residues of the native α‐helix in the native HA protein of interest displayed on the surface of the two‐stranded α‐helical coiled‐coil template. This template when used as an immunogen elicits polyclonal antibodies which bind to the α‐helix in the native protein. We investigated the highly conserved sequence region 421–476 of HA by inserting 21 or 28 residue sequences from this region into our template. The cross‐reactivity of the resulting rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared to these immunogens was determined using a series of HA proteins from H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 virus strains which are representative of Group 1 and Group 2 virus subtypes of influenza A. Antibodies from region 449–476 were Group 1 specific.

"Both innate and adaptative immune responses contribute to the control of infectious diseases, including by limiting the spreading of zoonotic diseases from animal reservoirs to humans. Pigs represent an important animal reservoir for influenza virus infection of human populations and are also naturally infected by coronaviruses, an important group of viruses, which includes the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Studies on both innate and adaptative immune responses of pigs to influenza virus and coronaviruses contribute, therefore, to a better control of these infections in their natural hosts and will be briefly reviewed in this article. Pro‐inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), were found in lung secretions of influenza virus infected pigs, and correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, whereas prior vaccination against influenza strongly reduced the production of infectious virus and cytokines in the lungs upon challenge, which was associated with clinical protection. An early type I IFN production was also found in coronavirus infected pigs, including at mucosal sites. IFN induction by coronavirus is shown to involve interaction between a viral glycoprotein and a leukocyte subset, likely equivalent to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, present in the mucosae and associated lymphoid tissues. Given the IFN mediated antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, the use of IFN or IFN inducers may prove an efficient strategy for a better control of influenza virus and coronavirus infections in pigs. Because influenza and coronaviruses target mucosal surfaces, adaptative immune responses have to be characterized at mucosal sites. Thus, nasal and pulmonary antibody responses were analyzed in influenza virus infected or vaccinated pigs showing short‐lived, but potentially protective local IgA and IgG antibody (Ab) responses. Interestingly, primary influenza virus infection induced long‐lived increase of lung CD8+ T cells and local lymphoproliferative responses. Pigs infected by a respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) showed virus‐specific IgG Ab‐secreting cells in the bronchial lymph nodes, whereas the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) induced more IgA Ab‐secreting cells in gut tissues, which illustrates the importance of the route of antigen administration for inducing local immune effector mechanisms. Porcine viral infections provide, therefore, valuable models for evaluating the immune parameters that are important for controlling transmission of important viral zoonotic infections.","multidisciplinary"
"Acute viral respiratory infections (AVRI) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among all age groups globally. Except for Influenza virus and Respiratory Syncytial virus, mostly viral aetiology of AVRI remains undiagnosed. Lately, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have emerged as an important aetiology of AVRI. A laboratory based retrospective cross sectional study was conducted in which respiratory samples (throat swabs) of patients (n = 864), with Influenza negative SARI, of all age groups between Jan 2011–Dec 2012 were tested for HCoVs including MERS‐CoV using Conventional and real time PCR assays. The prevalence of HCoV among SARI cases was 1.04% (9/864) [95% CI: 0.36–1.72]. Of these four (44.44%) were identified as HCoV OC43, three (33.33%) as HCoV NL63 and two (22.22%) as HCoV 229E. No HCoV HKU1 was detected. The samples were also negative for SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. The results of this study documents low prevalence of human coronaviruses in SARI cases in south western India and the absence of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.

"The Vaccine Research Center has developed a number of vaccine candidates for different diseases/infectious agents (HIV-1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, West Nile virus, and Ebola virus, plus a plasmid cytokine adjuvant—IL-2/Ig) based on a DNA plasmid vaccine platform. To support the clinical development of each of these vaccine candidates, preclinical studies have been performed in mice or rabbits to determine where in the body these plasmid vaccines would biodistribute and how rapidly they would clear. In the course of these studies, it has been observed that regardless of the gene insert (expressing the vaccine immunogen or cytokine adjuvant) and regardless of the promoter used to drive expression of the gene insert in the plasmid backbone, the plasmid vaccines do not biodistribute widely and remain essentially in the site of injection, in the muscle and overlying subcutis. Even though ∼ 1014 molecules are inoculated in the studies in rabbits, by day 8 or 9 (∼ 1 week postinoculation), already all but on the order of 104–106 molecules per microgram of DNA extracted from tissue have been cleared at the injection site. Over the course of 2 months, the plasmid clears from the site of injection with only a small percentage of animals (generally 10–20%) retaining a small number of copies (generally around 100 copies) in the muscle at the injection site. This pattern of biodistribution (confined to the injection site) and clearance (within 2 months) is consistent regardless of differences in the promoter in the plasmid backbone or differences in the gene insert being expressed by the plasmid vaccine. In addition, integration has not been observed with plasmid vaccine candidates inoculated i.m. by Biojector 2000 or by needle and syringe. These data build on the repeated-dose toxicology studies performed (see companion article, Sheets et al., 2006) to demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of DNA plasmid vaccine candidates for a variety of infectious disease prevention indications.","toxicology"
"The Vaccine Research Center has developed a number of vaccine candidates for different diseases/infectious agents (HIV-1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, West Nile virus, and Ebola virus, plus a plasmid cytokine adjuvant—IL-2/Ig) based on a DNA plasmid vaccine platform. To support the clinical development of each of these vaccine candidates, preclinical studies were performed to screen for potential toxicities (intrinsic and immunotoxicities). All treatment-related toxicities identified in these repeated-dose toxicology studies have been confined primarily to the sites of injection and seem to be the result of both the delivery method (as they are seen in both control and treated animals) and the intended immune response to the vaccine (as they occur with greater frequency and severity in treated animals). Reactogenicity at the site of injection is generally seen to be reversible as the frequency and severity diminished between doses and between the immediate and recovery termination time points. This observation also correlated with the biodistribution data reported in the companion article (Sheets et al., 2006), in which DNA plasmid vaccine was shown to remain at the site of injection, rather than biodistributing widely, and to clear over time. The results of these safety studies have been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration to support the safety of initiating clinical studies with these and related DNA plasmid vaccines. Thus far, standard repeated-dose toxicology studies have not identified any target organs for toxicity (other than the injection site) for our DNA plasmid vaccines at doses up to 8 mg per immunization, regardless of disease indication (i.e., expressed gene-insert) and despite differences (strengths) in the promoters used to drive this expression. As clinical data accumulate with these products, it will be possible to retrospectively compare the safety profiles of the products in the clinic to the results of the repeated-dose toxicology studies, in order to determine the utility of such toxicology studies for signaling potential immunotoxicities or intrinsic toxicities from DNA vaccines. These data build on the biodistribution studies performed (see companion article, Sheets et al., 2006) to demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of DNA plasmid vaccine candidates for a variety of infectious disease prevention indications.","toxicology"
"Motivation: RNA H-type pseudoknots are ubiquitous pseudoknots that are found in almost all classes of RNA and thought to play very important roles in a variety of biological processes. Detection of these RNA H-type pseudoknots can improve our understanding of RNA structures and their associated functions. However, the currently existing programs for detecting such RNA H-type pseudoknots are still time consuming and sometimes even ineffective. Therefore, efficient and effective tools for detecting the RNA H-type pseudoknots are needed. Results: In this paper, we have adopted a heuristic approach to develop a novel tool, called HPknotter, for efficiently and accurately detecting H-type pseudoknots in an RNA sequence. In addition, we have demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of HPknotter by testing on some sequences with known H-type pseudoknots. Our approach can be easily extended and applied to other classes of more general pseudoknots.

"Given the special role of insulin and leptin signaling in various biological responses, protein‐tyrosine phosphatase‐1B (PTP1B) was regarded as a novel therapeutic target for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, owing to the highly conserved (sequence identity of about 74%) in active pocket, targeting PTP1B for drug discovery is a great challenge. In this study, we employed the software package Discovery Studio to develop 3D QSAR pharmacophore models for PTP1B and TCPTP inhibitors. It was further validated by three methods (cost analysis, test set prediction, and Fisher's test) to show that the models can be used to predict the biological activities of compounds without costly and time‐consuming synthesis. The criteria for virtual screening were also validated by testing the selective PTP1B inhibitors. Virtual screening experiments and subsequent in vitro evaluation of promising hits revealed a novel and selective inhibitor of PTP1B over TCPTP. After that, a most likely binding mode was proposed. Thus, the findings reported here may provide a new strategy in discovering selective PTP1B inhibitors.","chemistry"
"The evolution of drug resistance is one of the most fundamental problems in medicine. In HIV/AIDS, the rapid emergence of drug‐resistant HIV‐1 variants is a major obstacle to current treatments. HIV‐1 protease inhibitors are essential components of present antiretroviral therapies. However, with these protease inhibitors, resistance occurs through viral mutations that alter inhibitor binding, resulting in a loss of efficacy. This loss of potency has raised serious questions with regard to effective long‐term antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS. In this context, our research has focused on designing inhibitors that form extensive hydrogen‐bonding interactions with the enzyme’s backbone in the active site. In doing so, we limit the protease’s ability to acquire drug resistance as the geometry of the catalytic site must be conserved to maintain functionality. In this Review, we examine the underlying principles of enzyme structure that support our backbone‐binding concept as an effective means to combat drug resistance and highlight their application in our recent work on antiviral HIV‐1 protease inhibitors.","chemistry"
"Peptide‐based antiviral therapeutics has gradually paved their way into mainstream drug discovery research. Experimental determination of peptides' antiviral activity as expressed by their IC50 values involves a lot of effort. Therefore, we have developed “AVP‐IC50Pred,” a regression‐based algorithm to predict the antiviral activity in terms of IC50 values (μM). A total of 759 non‐redundant peptides from AVPdb and HIPdb were divided into a training/test set having 683 peptides (T683) and a validation set with 76 independent peptides (V76) for evaluation. We utilized important peptide sequence features like amino‐acid compositions, binary profile of N8‐C8 residues, physicochemical properties and their hybrids. Four different machine learning techniques (MLTs) namely Support vector machine, Random Forest, Instance‐based classifier, and K‐Star were employed. During 10‐fold cross validation, we achieved maximum Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.66, 0.64, 0.56, 0.55, respectively, for the above MLTs using the best combination of feature sets. All the predictive models also performed well on the independent validation dataset and achieved maximum PCCs of 0.74, 0.68, 0.59, 0.57, respectively, on the best combination of feature sets. The AVP‐IC50Pred web server is anticipated to assist the researchers working on antiviral therapeutics by enabling them to computationally screen many compounds and focus experimental validation on the most promising set of peptides, thus reducing cost and time efforts.

"Background. In addition to the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43 and 229E, which have been known for decades to cause infection in humans, 2 new members of this genus have recently been identified: HCoVs NL63 and HKU1. Their impact as a cause of respiratory tract disease in adults at risk for complications needs to be established. Methods. We prospectively assessed the clinical impact of coronavirus infection (excluding cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome) among hospitalized adults. All patients with respiratory disease for whom bronchoalveolar lavage was performed were screened by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the presence of all 4 HCoVs. Results. HCoV was identified in 29 (5.4%) of 540 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens from 279 subjects (mean age, 51 years; 63% male). HCoV OC43 was identified most frequently (12 isolates), followed by 229E (7 isolates), NL63 (6 isolates), and HKU1 (4 isolates). In all, 372 (69%) of 540 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were negative for bacteria, and 2 persons were coinfected with other respiratory viruses. Transplantation was the most common underlying condition. Of the 29 patients who had HCoV identified in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, 9 (31%) were hospitalized in the intensive care unit, 22 (76%) presented to the hospital with acute respiratory symptoms, 16 (55%) presented with cough and/or sputum, 13 (45%) presented with dyspnea, 16 (55%) had experienced prior respiratory infection, and 18 (62%) had a new infiltrate that was visible on chest radiograph. The most frequent final diagnosis was a lower respiratory tract infection. Conclusions. The recently discovered HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infection. Our study also suggests that coronaviruses contribute to respiratory symptoms in most cases.","microbiology"
"A pan-viral DNA microarray, the Virochip (University of California, San Francisco), was used to detect human parainfluenzavirus 4 (HPIV-4) infection in an immunocompetent adult presenting with a life-threatening acute respiratory illness. The virus was identified in an endotracheal aspirate specimen, and the microarray results were confirmed by specific polymerase chain reaction and serological analysis for HPIV-4. Conventional clinical laboratory testing using an extensive panel of microbiological tests failed to yield a diagnosis. This case suggests that the potential severity of disease caused by HPIV-4 in adults may be greater than previously appreciated and illustrates the clinical utility of a microarray for broad-based viral pathogen screening.","microbiology"
"Abstract  Abstract  As a first step in conducting studies of airborne influenza transmission, we compared the collection performance of an SKC Biosampler, a compact cascade impactor (CCI), Teflon filters, and gelatin filters by collecting aerosolized influenza virus in a one‐pass aerosol chamber. Influenza virus infectivity was determined using a fluorescent focus assay and influenza virus nucleic acid (originating from viable and non‐viable viruses) was measured using quantitative PCR. The results showed that the SKC Biosampler recovered and preserved influenza virus infectivity much better than the other samplers – the CCI, Teflon, and gelatin filters recovered only 7–22% of infectious viruses compared with the Biosampler. Total virus collection was not significantly different among the SKC Biosampler, the gelatin, and Teflon filters, but was significantly lower in the CCI. Results from this study show that a new sampler is needed for virus aerosol sampling, as commercially available samplers do not efficiently collect and conserve virus infectivity. Applications for a new sampler include studies of airborne disease transmission and bioterrorism monitoring. Design parameters for a new sampler include high collection efficiency for fine particles and liquid sampling media to preserve infectivity.","public"
"Owing to its special role as a negative regulator in both insulin and leptin signaling, protein tyrosine phosphatase‐1B (PTP1B) has drawn considerable attention as a target for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity. It, however, is a great challenge to discover inhibitors specific to each PTP due to the highly homologous. In this study, a series of compounds were discovered to inhibit PTP1B based on imidazolidine‐2,4‐dione by means of ‘core hopping’. A selective PTP1B inhibitor (comp#h) was identified, and molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation were carried out to propose the most likely binding mode of comp#h with PTP1B. The findings reported here may provide a new strategy in discovering selective and effective inhibitors for treating diabetes.","chemistry"
"Myxovirus resistance A (MxA) is an antiviral protein induced by interferon α and β (IFN-α, IFN-β) that can inhibit viral replication. The minor alleles of the -88G>T and -123C>A MxA promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with increased promoter activity and altered response to IFN-α and IFN-β treatment. Here, we demonstrate that the 123A minor allele provided stronger binding affinity to nuclear proteins extracted from IFN-β-untreated cells than did the wild-type allele, whereas the -88T allele showed preferential binding after IFN-β stimulation. Endogenous IFN-α and IFN-β induction can be suppressed in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection. In support of our in vitro findings, a large case-control genetic-association study for SARS coronavirus infection confirmed that the -123A minor-allele carriers were significantly associated with lower risk of SARS coronavirus infection, whereas the -88T minorallele carriers were insignificant after adjustment for confounding effects. This suggests that -123C>A plays a more important role in modulating basal MxA expression, thus contributing more significantly to innate immune response against viral infections that suppress endogenous IFN-α and IFN-β induction such as SARS coronavirus.","microbiology"
"Cross-reactivity between antibodies to different human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has not been systematically studied. By use of Western blot analysis, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigenic cross-reactivity between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)—associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2 HCoVs (229E and OC43) was demonstrated in immunized animals and human serum. In 5 of 11 and 10 of 11 patients with SARS, paired serum samples showed a ⩾4-fold increase in antibody titers against HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, respectively, by IFA. Overall, serum samples from convalescent patients who had SARS had a 1-way cross-reactivity with the 2 known HCoVs. Antigens of SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 were more cross-reactive than were those of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E.","microbiology"
"Background. The etiological agents responsible for a substantial proportion of respiratory tract diseases have not been identified. We sought to determine whether novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are circulating in New Haven, Connecticut, and, if so, whether they are associated with respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. Methods. We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach for screening specimens from the respiratory tracts of symptomatic children. PCR probes that target regions of the replicase 1a gene that are conserved among genetically diverse animal CoVs and HCoVs were designed. Using these probes, we identified genomic sequences of a novel HCoV, designated “New Haven coronavirus” (HCoV-NH). Thereafter, we designed specific probes to screen respiratory specimens from children <5 years old for this novel HCoV. Clinical features associated with HCoV-NH infection were identified. Results. Seventy-nine (8.8%) of 895 children tested positive for HCoV-NH. Cough, rhinorrhea, tachypnea, fever, abnormal breath sounds, and hypoxia were the most common findings associated with HCoV-NH infection. Sequence analysis revealed that HCoV-NH is closely related to a novel HCoV recently reported in The Netherlands. Conclusions. The novel HCoVs identified in New Haven and The Netherlands are similar and likely represent the same species. This newly discovered virus may have worldwide distribution and may account for a significant proportion of respiratory tract disease in infants and young children.","microbiology"
"Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis of childhood; its etiology is unknown. We identified evidence of a novel human coronavirus, designated “New Haven coronavirus” (HCoVNH), in respiratory secretions from a 6-month-old infant with classic Kawasaki disease. To further investigate the possible association between HCoV-NH infection and Kawasaki disease, we conducted a case-control study. Specimens of respiratory secretions from 8 (72.7%) of 11 children with Kawasaki disease and from 1 (4.5%) of 22 control subjects (children without Kawasaki disease matched by age and the time the specimens were obtained) tested positive for HCoVNH by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Mantel-Haenszel matched odds ratio, 16.0 [95% confidence interval, 3.4–74.4]; P = .0015). These data suggest that HCoV-NH infection is associated with Kawasaki disease.","microbiology"
"The isolation of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) in The Netherlands raised questions about its contribution to respiratory illness. In this study, a total of 525 respiratory specimens, collected in Canada primarily during the winter months of 2001–2002, were tested for HCoV-NL63; 19 tested positive for HCoV-NL63, demonstrating virus activity during January–March 2002. Patients with HCoV-NL63 were 1 month-100 years old (median age, 37 years). The main clinical presentations were fever (15/19), sore throat (5/19), and cough (9/19), and 4 patients were hospitalized. These results provide evidence for the worldwide distribution of HCoV-NL63.","microbiology"
"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) remains a significant public health concern after the epidemic in 2003. Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that neutralize SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV) could provide protection for exposed individuals. Methods. Transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes were immunized with the recombinant major surface (S) glycoprotein ectodomain of SARS-CoV. Epitopes of 2 neutralizing MAbs derived from these mice were mapped and evaluated in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection. Results. Both MAbs bound to S glycoprotein expressed on transfected cells but differed in their ability to block binding of S glycoprotein to Vero E6 cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed 2 antibody-binding epitopes: one MAb (201) bound within the receptor-binding domain at aa 490–510, and the other MAb (68) bound externally to the domain at aa 130–150. Mice that received 40 mg/kg of either MAb prior to challenge with SARS-CoV were completely protected from virus replication in the lungs, and doses as low as 1.6 mg/kg offered significant protection. Conclusions. Two neutralizing epitopes were defined for MAbs to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Antibodies to both epitopes protected mice against SARS-CoV challenge. Clinical trials are planned to test MAb 201, a fully human MAb specific for the epitope within the receptor-binding region.","microbiology"
"Highly efficient antibody immobilization is extremely crucial for the development of high‐performance polymeric microdevices for enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this article, a site‐selective tyrosinase (TR)‐catalyzed protein A strategy for antibody immobilization was developed to enhance the sensitivity of ELISA in poly‐(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microchannels for interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) assay. To effectively immobilize the target antibodies, oxygen plasma was first used to activate the inert PMMA. This is followed by poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) coating, an amine‐containing functional polymer. For comparison, protein A was also immobilized through the commonly used amine‐glutaraldehyde (GA) chemistry. Oxygen plasma treatment effectively increased the amount of PEI attachment and subsequent binding efficiency of the primary antibody. The antibody immobilized via TR‐catalyzed protein A was able to provide much better specific antigen capture efficiency than GA chemistry due to the optimal spacing and orientation. Consequently, by using this new method, the detection signal and the signal‐to‐noise ratio of the ELISA immunoassay in microdevices were all significantly improved. In comparison to the standard assay carried out in the 96‐well microtiter plate, the treated microchannels exhibited a broader detection range and a shorter detection time. And the detection limit was also decreased to 20 pg/mL, much lower than that obtained in other microdevices. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009; 102: 891–901. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biotechnology"
"The association between severe bronchiolitis and dual infection by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) was investigated in !2-year-old infants with bronchiolitis who were admitted to the hospital during the 2001–2002 winter season. hMPV in nasopharyngeal aspirate and/or cells and fluid collected by nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). hRSV was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate and/or cells and fluid collected by nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage by enzyme immunoassay, tissue culture, and RT-PCR. Dual infection with hMPV and hRSV confers a 10-fold increase in relative risk (RR) of admission to a pediatric intensive-care unit for mechanical ventilation (RR, 10.99 [95% confidence interval, 5.0–24.12]; P < .001, by Fisher exact test).

"Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first reported in November 2002 in China, and spreads to about 30 countries over the next few months. While the characteristics of epidemic transmission are individually assessed, there are also important implicit associations between them. Methods A novel methodological framework was developed to overcome barriers among separate epidemic statistics and identify distinctive SARS features. Individual statistics were pair-wise linked in terms of their common features, and an integrative epidemic network was formulated. Results The study of associations between important SARS characteristics considerably enhanced the mainstream epidemic analysis and improved the understanding of the relationships between the observed epidemic determinants. The response of SARS transmission to various epidemic control factors was simulated, target areas were detected, critical time and relevant factors were determined. Conclusion It was shown that by properly accounting for links between different SARS statistics, a data-based analysis can efficiently reveal systematic associations between epidemic determinants. The analysis can predict the temporal trend of the epidemic given its spatial pattern, to estimate spatial exposure given temporal evolution, and to infer the driving forces of SARS transmission given the spatial exposure distribution.","public"
"Background. We examined the role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting. Methods. We investigated a seasonal influenza A outbreak that occurred in our general medical ward (with open bay ward layout) in 2008. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected in real time during the outbreak. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed to estimate the infection risk among patients. Airflow measurements were conducted, and concentrations of hypothetical virus-laden aerosols at different ward locations were estimated using computational fluid dynamics modeling. Results. Nine inpatients were infected with an identical strain of influenza A/H3N2 virus. With reference to the index patient's location, the attack rate was 20.0% and 22.2% in the “same” and “adjacent” bays, respectively, but 0% in the “distant” bay (P=.04). Temporally, the risk of being infected was highest on the day when noninvasive ventilation was used in the index patient; multivariate logistic regression revealed an odds ratio of 14.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–131.3; P=.015). A simultaneous, directional indoor airflow blown from the “same” bay toward the “adjacent” bay was found; it was inadvertently created by an unopposed air jet from a separate air purifier placed next to the index patient's bed. Computational fluid dynamics modeling revealed that the dispersal pattern of aerosols originated from the index patient coincided with the bed locations of affected patients. Conclusions. Our findings suggest a possible role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting. Source and engineering controls, such as avoiding aerosol generation and improving ventilation design, may warrant consideration to prevent nosocomial outbreaks.","microbiology"
"Triterpenes found in plants display a multitude of biological activities, including anti‐tumor properties. The present study investigates the effect of 18β‐glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) a pentacyclic triterpenoid of the β‐amyrin type, isolated from the root of Licorice (Glycyrrhizza glabra) on human breast cancer cells, MCF‐7. GRA showed potent inhibitory effects on MCF‐7 proliferation in a concentration‐ and time‐dependent manner without affecting immortalized normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF‐10A). Growth inhibition of MCF‐7 cells by GRA occurred through apoptosis, as evident from phosphatidyl serine externalization and DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis was primarily mediated through mitochondrial death cascade as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase‐9. GRA induced an increase in Bax:Bcl‐2 ratio along with a significant increase in the protein level of the BH3 protein Bim. SiRNA‐mediated knock down of Bim markedly attenuated GRA‐mediated apoptosis. Profiling of transcriptional regulators of Bim revealed a role of Forkhead box O 3a transcription factor (FOXO3a) as judged by increased expression and nuclear translocation of FOXO3a. Silencing of FOXO3a resulted in marked attenuation in the expression of Bim as well as protection against GRA‐mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, GRA‐induced activation and nuclear localization of FOXO3a was associated with a reduced activity of Akt kinase. These results suggest that GRA induces apoptosis in human breast carcinoma MCF‐7 cells via caspase activation and modulation of Akt/FOXO3a pathway. J. Cell.

"Background. Given the apparent high mortality associated with the novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus (S-OIV) in Mexico, we aimed to study the cytokine profiles induced by S-OIV and the effect of immunomodulators. Methods. We assayed cytokines and their messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in culture supernatants of human macrophages infected with H5N1, S-OIV California/04/2009 (S-OIV-CA), S-OIV Hong Kong/415742 (S-OIV-HK), or seasonal H1N1 with or without celecoxib and mesalazine. Results. Among the 12 cytokines showing detectable levels, levels of 8 proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL] 2R, IL-6, interferon [IFN] α, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP] α, MIP-1b, IFN-induced protein 10, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES], and monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP] 1) were higher in cells infected by H5N1 but similar among cells infected with H1N1, S-OIV-CA, or SOIV- HK. The levels of the other 4 cytokines were similar for H5N1, H1N1, S-OIV-CA and S-OIV-HK. Among the 8 cytokines induced by H5N1, 6 were suppressed by celecoxib and mesalazine. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor a, IFN-γ, IL-6, and MCP-1 induced by H5N1 were higher than the levels of other cytokines at 12 and/or 24 h. Conclusions. No major cytokine storm, as seen in H5N1 infection, is associated with S-OIV infection of cell lines. The mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated S-OIV infections should be antiviral agents without immunomodulators. For individual S-OIV-infected patients with severe primary viral pneumonia, severe sepsis, and multiorgan failure, immunomodulators may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in clinical trials.","microbiology"
"Macro domains or X domains are found as modules of multidomain proteins, but can also constitute a protein on their own.

"Background. This study was performed to evaluate the associations of newly recognized viruses, namely, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV)–NL63, and human bocavirus (HBoV) with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in previously healthy children. Methods. To determine the prevalences of 11 viruses—respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1 and 3, influenza viruses A and B, hMPV, HCoV, HCoV-NL63, and HBoV—among infants or children with LRTIs, in association with their epidemiologic characteristics, we performed multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from 515 children 5 years old with LRTIs during the period 2000–2005. Results. Viruses were identified in 312 (60.6%) of the 515 patients. RSV was detected in 122 (23.7%), HBoV in 58 (11.3%), adenovirus in 35 (6.8%), PIV-3 in 32 (6.2%), rhinovirus in 30 (5.8%), hMPV in 24 (4.7%), influenza A in 24 (4.7%), PIV-1 in 9 (1.7%), influenza B in 9 (1.7%), and HCoV-NL63 in 8 (1.6%). Coinfections with 2 viruses were observed in 36 patients (11.5%). Twenty-two patients (37.9%) infected with HBoV had a coinfection. Bronchiolitis was frequently diagnosed in patients who tested positive for RSV, PIV-3, or rhinovirus, whereas influenza A, PIV-1, and HCoV-NL63 were commonly found in patients with croup. The age distributions of patients with viral infections differed; notably, RSV was responsible for 77% of LRTIs that occurred in infants 3 months old. The number of hMPV infections peaked between February and April, whereas the number of HCoV-NL63 infections peaked between April and May. Conclusions. This study describes the features of LRTIs associated with newly identified viruses in children, compared with those associated with known viruses. Additional investigations are required to define the role of HBoV in LRTI.","microbiology"
"Laboratory-acquired infections due to a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites have been described. Although the precise risk of infection after an exposure remains poorly defined, surveys of laboratory-acquired infections suggest that Brucella species, Shigella species, Salmonella species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Neisseria meningitidis are the most common causes. Infections due to the bloodborne pathogens (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus) remain the most common reported viral infections, whereas the dimorphic fungi are responsible for the greatest number of fungal infections. Because of the increasing attention on the role of the laboratory in bioterrorism preparation, I discuss the risk of laboratory-acquired infection with uncommon agents, such as Francisella tularensis and Bacillus anthracis. Physicians who care for a sick laboratory worker need to consider the likelihood of an occupationally acquired infection while advising exposed laboratory workers about postexposure prophylaxis. In addition, physicians should be aware of the importance of alerting the laboratory if infection with a high-risk agent is suspected.","microbiology"

"Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness; the virus is endemic in West Africa and also of concern with regard to bioterrorism. Transmission of Lassa virus between humans may occur through direct contact with infected blood or bodily secretions. Oral administration of the antiviral drug ribavirin is often considered for postexposure prophylaxis, but no systematically collected data or uniform guidelines exist for this indication. Furthermore, the relatively low secondary attack rates for Lassa fever, the restriction of the area of endemicity to West Africa, and the infrequency of high-risk exposures make it unlikely that controlled prospective efficacy trials will ever be possible. Recommendations for postexposure use of ribavirin can therefore be made only on the basis of a thorough understanding and logical extrapolation of existing data. Here, we review the pertinent issues and propose guidelines based on extensive review of the literature, as well as our experience in this field. We recommend oral ribavirin postexposure prophylaxis for Lassa fever exclusively for definitive high-risk exposures. These guidelines may also serve for exposure to other hemorrhagic fever viruses susceptible to ribavirin.","microbiology"
"An 8‐week feeding experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on growth, survival and immune response of juvenile large yellow croaker, in seawater floating net cages. GA was supplemented into the basal diet to formulate four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic practical diets containing 0.00% (the control diet), 0.01%, 0.02% and 0.04% GA of dry weight, respectively. Triplicate groups of 60 fish were fed to apparent satiation by hand twice daily. The results showed that the specific growth rate, survival rate and feed efficiency ratio revealed no significant differences among dietary treatments (P > 0.05). The phagocytic index of head kidney macrophage was significantly increased by the supplementation of 0.04% dietary GA compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Fish fed 0.04% dietary GA also showed significantly higher serum lysozyme activity than fish fed the control diet and diet with 0.01% GA (P < 0.05). The cumulative mortality rate after natural infestation of parasites (protozoan, Cryptocaryon irritans Brown) showed no significant differences among dietary treatments. These results suggested that dietary glycyrrhizic acid improved certain non‐specific immunological parameters of juvenile large yellow croaker. However, GA was not able to protect juvenile large yellow croaker effectively from protozoan infection.","fisheries"

The number of coronavirus species with complete genomes available has increased from 9 in 2003 to 25 in 2007, of which six, including coronavirus HKU1, bat SARS coronavirus, group 1 bat coronavirus HKU2, groups 2c and 2d coronaviruses, were sequenced by our laboratory. To overcome the problems we encountered in the existing databases during comparative sequence analysis, we built a comprehensive database, CoVDB (http://covdb.microbiology.hku.hk), of annotated coronavirus genes and genomes. CoVDB provides a convenient platform for rapid and accurate batch sequence retrieval, the cornerstone and bottleneck for comparative gene or genome analysis. Sequences can be directly downloaded from the website in FASTA format. CoVDB also provides detailed annotation of all coronavirus sequences using a standardized nomenclature system, and overcomes the problems of duplicated and identical sequences in other databases. For complete genomes, a single representative sequence for each species is available for comparative analysis such as phylogenetic studies. With the annotated sequences in CoVDB, more specific blast search results can be generated for efficient downstream analysis.","biochemistry"
"The NIAID-funded Biodefense Proteomics Resource Center (RC) provides storage, dissemination, visualization and analysis capabilities for the experimental data deposited by seven Proteomics Research Centers (PRCs). The data and its publication is to support researchers working to discover candidates for the next generation of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics against NIAID's Category A, B and C priority pathogens. The data includes transcriptional profiles, protein profiles, protein structural data and host–pathogen protein interactions, in the context of the pathogen life cycle in vivo and in vitro. The database has stored and supported host or pathogen data derived from Bacillus, Brucella, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, SARS, Toxoplasma, Vibrio and Yersinia, human tissue libraries, and mouse macrophages. These publicly available data cover diverse data types such as mass spectrometry, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), gene expression profiles, X-ray and NMR determined protein structures and protein expression clones. The growing database covers over 23 000 unique genes/proteins from different experiments and organisms. All of the genes/proteins are annotated and integrated across experiments using UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) accession numbers. The web-interface for the database enables searching, querying and downloading at the level of experiment, group and individual gene(s)/protein(s) via UniProtKB accession numbers or protein function keywords.

"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of regulatory RNAs in host–pathogen interactions. Aberrant miRNA expression seems to play a central role in the pathology of several respiratory viruses, promoting development and progression of infection. miRNAs may thus serve as therapeutic and prognostic factors for respiratory viral infectious disease caused by a variety of agents. We present a comprehensive review of recent findings related to the role of miRNAs in different respiratory viral infections and discuss possible therapeutic opportunities aiming to attenuate the burden of viral infections. Our review supports the emerging concept that cellular and viral‐encoded miRNAs might be broadly implicated in human respiratory viral infections, with either positive or negative effects on virus life cycle.

"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major global health issue. The role of rare genetic variants in CHB has not been elucidated. We aimed to identify rare allelic variants predisposing to CHB. We performed exome sequencing in 50 CHB patients who had no identifiable risk factors for CHB and 40 controls who were healthy and hepatitis B surface antibody‐positive, but had never received hepatitis B vaccination. We selected six rare variant alleles and followed up their association with disease status by Sanger sequencing in a case‐control study comprising 1,728 CHB patients and 1,636 healthy controls. The latter had either not been immunized with hepatitis B vaccine or had uncertain vaccination status. Our results showed that transmembrane protein 2 p.Ser1254Asn, interferon alpha 2 p.Ala120Thr, its regulator NLR family member X1 p.Arg707Cys, and complement component 2 p.Glu318Asp were associated with CHB, with P values of <1.0 × 10−7, 2.76 × 10−5, 5.08 × 10−5, 2.78 × 10−4 and odds ratios (ORs) of 2.45, 4.08, 2.34, and 1.97, respectively. The combined P value was <2.0 × 10−16. As there has been no indication of immunological functions for the associated gene, transmembrane protein 2, we further studied its expression by immunohistochemistry, real‐time polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting. Our results showed that it was strongly expressed by healthy hepatocytes, but its expression was reduced in liver tissues with CHB, hepatitis B viral (HBV) genome‐containing HepG2.2.15 cells, as compared with healthy liver tissues and non‐HBV genome‐containing HepG2 cells (P = 0.022 and 0.0036, respectively). Conclusion: We identified four missense mutations associated with CHB, our results providing evidence for rare inborn genetic defects that contribute to increased host susceptibility to CHB.

"Objectives. To investigate whether cyclophilin A (CypA) can up-regulate the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in monocytes/macrophages and whether CD147 facilitates this regulation in RA. Methods. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from RA patients and differentiated into macrophages by M-CSF (15 ng/ml). Under CypA stimulation (200 ng/ml), the protein release and activation of MMPs were detected by gelatin zymography and invasion assay. Human monocyte cell line THP-1 cells were selected for the advanced searching for potential interaction between CypA and CD147 in production of MMPs and cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM). Results. CypA significantly increased production and activation of MMP-9, not MMP-2, in the monocytes/macrophages derived from RA SF. CSA and HAb18G/CD147 antagonistic peptide AP-9 against CD147, respectively, dramatically decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, both in the absence or presence of CypA. Similar effects of CypA on MMP-9 production and cell invasion were observed in THP-1 cells. CypA-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity for MMP-9 transcription were strongly blocked by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors (U0126 and SP600125, respectively), but not by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors (SB203580). CypA also induced calcium mobilization and increased the adhesion of THP-1 cells to ECM. Conclusions. These findings suggest that in RA, the abundant CypA, by its direct binding to CD147, up-regulates MMP-9 expression and adhesion of monocytes/macrophages to ECM, and the cyclophilin-CD147 interactions might contribute to the destruction of cartilage and bone.","rheumatology"
"Viruses account for a substantial portion of respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia, in the elderly population. Presently, influenza virus A H3N2 and respiratory syncytial virus are the most commonly identified viral pathogens in older adults with viral pneumonia. As diagnostic tests such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction become more widely used, the relative importance of additional viruses (such as parainfluenza, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus) will likely increase. Influenza virus should be considered as a cause of pneumonia during the winter months, especially during periods of peak activity. Patients with high-grade fever, myalgias, and cough should arouse the highest suspicion. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia should also be suspected during the winter in patients with coryza, wheezing, low-grade fever, and patchy infiltrates, especially if negative for influenza on rapid testing. Because clinical features and periods of activity for many viruses overlap, laboratory confirmation of influenza is recommended for cases involving seriously ill or institutionalized patients.","microbiology"
"Background. Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), a new group 2 coronavirus, was first characterized in 2005 from 2 adults with pneumonia in Hong Kong, China. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other report to date about the detection of this new virus. We report a molecular method allowing for the detection of HCoV-HKU1 and also report the clinical presentation of 6 infected patients. Methods. We screened 141 specimens (135 nasal samples and 6 stool samples) received in February and March 2005 in our laboratory and obtained from 135 hospitalized patients (61.5% of whom were <5 years old and 34.1% of whom were >20 years old) for HCoV-HKU1. Results. HCoV-HKU1 was detected in 6 (4.4%) of the 135 nasal specimens and in 2 (33.3%) of the 6 stool samples; the positive samples were obtained from 6 patients (5 children and 1 adult). The clinical presentation of these 6 patients was as follows: 3 were admitted to the hospital for acute enteric disease resulting in severe dehydration associated with upper respiratory symptoms; 1 had fever, otitis, and febrile seizure; 1 had a sample obtained to investigate failure to thrive; and 1 had a sample obtained for exploration of X-linked agammaglobulinemia and hyperleucocytosis. Conclusion. HCoV-HKU1 can be detected in respiratory and stool samples from children and adults in a part of the world other than Hong Kong. Our results suggest that HCoV-HKU1 could be associated with respiratory and enteric diseases, and its detection can be related to a persistent asymptomatic infection in patients with poor underlying conditions.","microbiology"
"Aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) pathway has been implicated in the development of human malignancies. This study aimed at investigating the role of HH molecules in human ovarian carcinogenesis. The expression profiles of HH molecules were examined in ovarian tumor samples and ovarian cancer cell lines and the in vitro effects of HH molecules on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and cell differentiation as well as related downstream target genes were assessed. Overexpression of Patched and Gli1 protein in ovarian cancers correlated with poor survival of the patients (P = 0.008; P = 0.004). Significantly elevated expression of Sonic hedgehog messenger RNA was observed in ovarian cancers compared with normal tissues and benign ovarian tumors and such differential expression was specific to histological types (P < 0.05). Ectopic Gli1 overexpression in ovarian cancer cells conferred increased cell proliferation, cell mobility, invasiveness and change in differentiation in association with increased expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, Bcl-2, caspases as well as β1 integrin, membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Treatment with 3-keto-N-(aminoethyl-aminocaproyl-dihydrocinnamoyl)-cyclopamine induced cancer cell apoptosis, suppressed cell growth, mobility and invasiveness and induced cancer cell dedifferentiation with decreased expression of E-cadherin, cytokeratin 7, Snail, calretinin, vimentin, Bcl-2, caspases, β1 integrin, MT1-MMP and VEGF. Our data suggested that abnormal HH signaling activation plays important roles in the development and progression of ovarian cancers. Gli1 expression is an independent prognostic marker. Inhibition of the HH pathway molecules might be a valid therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancers.","oncology"
"A 1320‐bp cDNA containing the full coding region of the porcine succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit D (SDHD) gene was obtained by random sequencing of clones from a Chinese Tongcheng pig 55‐day fetal longissimus dorsi muscle cDNA library. Analysis of the SDHD gene across the INRA‐University of Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid panel indicated close linkage with microsatellite marker SW2401, located on SSC9p21. The open reading frame of this cDNA covers 480 bp and encodes 159 amino acids. The deduced porcine amino acid sequence showed greater similarity with human and bovine protein sequences than with those from mouse and rat. The BLAST analysis of the porcine SDHD to NCBI identified Unigene Cluster Ssc.2586. Possible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified by alignment of expressed sequence tags in the cluster. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single strand conformation polymorphism, sequencing, and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to confirm and detect a synonymous polymorphic MboI site within the open‐reading frame. Allele frequencies of this SNP were investigated in two commercial and five Chinese local pig breeds. These five Chinese breeds had very high frequencies for one allele, whereas frequencies of both alleles were intermediate in Large White and Duroc. An association analysis suggested that different SDHD genotypes have significant differences in loin‐muscle area (P < 0.01).","genetics"
"The entire life cycle of influenza virus involves viral attachment, entry, replication, and release. Previous studies have demonstrated that neuraminidase (NA) is an essential glycoprotein on the surface of influenza virus and that it is responsible for release of progeny virions from the host cell to infect new cells. However, recent studies have also suggested that NA may play other roles in the early stages of the viral life cycle, that is, viral attachment and entry. This review focuses on the new role of NA in the early stages of influenza life cycle and the corresponding development of novel NA inhibitors. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","virology"
"Enteroviruses are common human pathogens, and infections are particularly frequent in children. Severe infections can lead to a variety of diseases, including poliomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis and neonatal sepsis. Enterovirus infections have also been implicated in asthmatic exacerbations and type 1 diabetes. The large disease spectrum of the closely related enteroviruses may be partially, but not fully, explained by differences in tissue tropism. The molecular mechanisms by which enteroviruses cause disease are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that the two enteroviral proteases, 2Apro and 3Cpro, are important mediators of pathology. These proteases perform the post‐translational proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein, but they also cleave several host‐cell proteins in order to promote the production of new virus particles, as well as to evade the cellular antiviral immune responses. Enterovirus‐associated processing of cellular proteins may also contribute to pathology, as elegantly demonstrated by the 2Apro‐mediated cleavage of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes contributing to Coxsackievirus‐induced cardiomyopathy. It is likely that improved tools to identify targets for these proteases will reveal additional host protein substrates that can be linked to specific enterovirus‐associated diseases. Here, we discuss the function of the enteroviral proteases in the virus replication cycle and review the current knowledge regarding how these proteases modulate the infected cell in order to favour virus replication, including ways to avoid detection by the immune system. We also highlight new possibilities for the identification of protease‐specific cellular targets and thereby a way to discover novel mechanisms contributing to disease.

"Lujo virus is a novel Old World arenavirus identified in Southern Africa in 2008 as the cause of a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) characterized by nosocomial transmission with a high case fatality rate of 80% (4/5 cases). Whereas this outbreak was limited, the unprecedented Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, and recent Zika virus disease epidemic in the Americas, has brought into acute focus the need for preparedness to respond to rare but potentially highly pathogenic outbreaks of zoonotic or arthropod‐borne viral infections. A key determinant for effective control of a VHF outbreak is the time between primary infection and diagnosis of the index case. Here, we review the Lujo VHF outbreak of 2008 and discuss how preparatory measures with respect to developing diagnostic capacity might be effectively embedded into existing national disease control networks, such as those for human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria.","virology"
"Preclinical Research Infectomics, a novel way to globally and comprehensively understand the interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts, has significantly expanded understanding of the microbial infections. The infectomics view of viral–host interactions on the viral perspective principally focuses on gene acquisition, deletion, and point mutation, while traditional antiviral drug discovery concentrates on viral encoding proteins. Recently, high‐throughput technologies, such as mass spectrometry‐based proteomics, activity‐based protein profiling, microarray analysis, yeast two‐hybrid assay, small interfering RNA screening, and micro RNA profiling, have been gradually employed in the research of virus–host interactions. Besides, signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in viral–host interactions provide new insights of infectomics in antiviral drug discovery. In this review, we summarize related infectomics approaches in the studies of virus–host interactions, which shed light on the development of novel antiviral drug targets screening.","pharmacology"
"Preclinical Research Omics technologies include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and immunomics. These technologies have been used in vaccine research, which can be summarized using the term “vaccinomics.” These omics technologies combined with advanced bioinformatics analysis form the core of “systems vaccinology.” Omics technologies provide powerful methods in vaccine target identification. The genomics‐based reverse vaccinology starts with predicting vaccine protein candidates through in silico bioinformatics analysis of genome sequences. The VIOLIN Vaxign vaccine design program (http://www.violinet.org/vaxign) is the first web‐based vaccine target prediction software based on the reverse vaccinology strategy. Systematic transcriptomics and proteomics analyses facilitate rational vaccine target identification by detesting genome‐wide gene expression profiles. Immunomics is the study of the set of antigens recognized by host immune systems and has also been used for efficient vaccine target prediction. With the large amount of omics data available, it is necessary to integrate various vaccine data using ontologies, including the Gene Ontology (GO) and Vaccine Ontology (VO), for more efficient vaccine target prediction and assessment. All these omics technologies combined with advanced bioinformatics analysis methods for a systems biology‐based vaccine target prediction strategy. This article reviews the various omics technologies and how they can be used in vaccine target identification.","pharmacology"
"Objectives/Hypothesis: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by coronavirus has become an epidemic affecting many regions worldwide. Fourteen percent to 20% of patients require endotracheal intubation and ventilator support. Some of these patients may require tracheostomy subsequently. This procedure, when performed without protection, may lead to infection of the medical and nursing staff taking care of the patient. Study Design: Based on clinical information of three patients. Methods: The authors carried out an emergency tracheostomy and changed the tracheostomy tube for one patient and performed elective tracheostomy in another two patients. Results: No medical or nursing staff member was infected after carrying out the procedure while taking all the precautions and wearing the appropriate protective apparel. Conclusion: The authors have prepared guidelines for performing a safe tracheostomy under both elective and emergency conditions. Surgeons who might be involved in performing the tracheostomy should become familiar with these guidelines and the appropriate protective apparel.","otorhinolaryngology"
"Protein–protein interactions, as well as peptide–peptide and peptide–protein interactions are fields of study of growing importance as molecular‐level detail is avidly pursued in drug design, metabolic regulation and molecular dynamics, among other classes of studies. In membranes, this issue is particularly relevant because lipid bilayers potentiate molecular interactions due to the high local concentration of peptides and other solutes. However, experimental techniques and methodologies to detect and quantify such interactions are not abundant. A reliable, fast and inexpensive alternative methodology is revisited in this work. Considering the interaction of two molecules, at least one of them being fluorescent, either intrinsically (e.g. Trp residues) or by grafting a specific probe, changes in their aggregation state may be reported, as long as the fluorophore is sensitive to local changes in polarity, conformation and/or exposure to the solvent. The interaction will probably lead to modifications in fluorescence intensity resulting in a decrease (‘quenching’) or enhancement (‘dequenching’). Although the presented methodology is based on static quenching methodologies, the concept is extended from quenching to any kind of interference with the fluorophore. Equations for data analysis are shown and their applications are illustrated by calculating the binding constant for several data‐sets.

"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) has been discovered. The detection of both antigens and antibodies in SARS‐CoV from human specimens with suspected SARS plays an important role in preventing infection. We developed a novel rapid immunochromatographic test (RICT) based on the sandwich format enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with an all‐in‐one device for detecting the native nucleocapsid antigen (N‐Ag) of SARS‐CoV using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), which we produced by immunizing recombinant N‐Ag to mice. RICT is a qualitative assay for respiratory aspirates and serum specimens. With this assay, a positive result can be judged subjectively by the appearance of a blue line on the device 15 min after the sample is applied. RICT with several pairs of MoAbs showed a high sensitivity for the detection of recombinant N‐Ag as well as viral N‐Ag of SARS‐CoV. rSN122 and rSN21‐2 were the best MoAbs for immobilized antibody and enzyme labeling, respectively. With regard to analytical sensitivity, RICT detected N‐Ag at 31 pg/mL for recombinant N‐Ag, and at 1.99×102 TCID50/mL for SARS‐CoV. The specificity of RICT was 100% when 150 human sera and 50 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NSPs) were used. RICT based on an EIA using the rSN122/rSN21‐2 pair is a sensitive, specific, and reliable rapid assay for detecting N‐Ag in SARS‐CoV treated with either heat or Triton X‐100. J. Clin. Lab.

"The active site of 3CL proteinase (3CLpro) for coronavirus was identified by comparing the crystal structures of human and porcine coronavirus. The inhibitor of the main protein of rhinovirus (Ag7088) could bind with 3CLpro of human coronavirus, then it was selected as the reference for molecular docking and database screening. The ligands from two databases were used to search potential lead structures with molecular docking. Several structures from natural products and ACD‐SC databases were found to have lower binding free energy with 3CLpro than that of Ag7088. These structures have similar hydrophobicity to Ag7088. They have complementary electrostatic potential and hydrogen bond acceptor and donor with 3CLpro, showing that the strategy of anti‐SARS drug design based on molecular docking and database screening is feasible.","chemistry"
"summary.  A novel human coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in epidemic form in early 2003 in China and spread worldwide in a few months. Every newly emerging human pathogen is of concern for the safety of the blood supply during and after an epidemic crisis. For this purpose, we have evaluated the inactivation of SARS‐coronavirus (CoV) in platelet concentrates using an approved pathogen inactivation device, the INTERCEPT Blood System. Apheresis platelet concentrates (APCs) were inoculated with approximately 106 pfu mL−1 of either Urbani or HSR1 isolates of SARS‐CoV. The inoculated units were mixed with 150 µm amotosalen and illuminated with 3 J cm−2 UV‐A light. The viral titres were determined by plaque formation in Vero E6 cells. Mixing SARS‐CoV with APC in the absence of any treatment decreased viral infectivity by approximately 0·5–1 log10. Following photochemical treatment, SARS‐CoV was consistently inactivated to the limit of detection in seven independent APC units. No infectious virus was detected after treatment when up to one‐third of the APC unit was assayed, demonstrating a mean log10‐reduction of >6·2. Potent inactivation of SARS‐CoV therefore extends the capability of the INTERCEPT Blood System in inactivating a broad spectrum of human pathogens including recently emerging respiratory viruses.","hematology"
"To study how the P19 suppressor of gene‐silencing protein can be used effectively for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins, the following factors were examined: the genetic elements used for expressing recombinant proteins; the effect of different P19 concentrations; compatibility of P19 with various Nicotiana tabacum cultivars for transgenic expression; the glycan profile of a recombinant therapeutic glycoprotein co‐expressed with P19 in an RNAi‐based glycomodified Nicotiana benthamiana expression host. The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains of trastuzumab were cloned into five plant expression vectors (102–106) containing different 5′ and 3′ UTRs, designated as vector sets 102–106 mAb. The P19 protein of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) was also cloned into vector 103, which contained the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and 5′UTR together with the terminator region of the nopaline synthase gene of Agrobacterium. Transient expression of the antibody vectors resulted in different levels of trastuzumab accumulation, the highest being 105 and 106 mAb at about 1% of TSP. P19 increased the concentration of trastuzumab approximately 15‐fold (to about 2.3% of TSP) when co‐expressed with 103 mAb but did not affect antibody levels with vectors 102 and 106 mAb. When 103 mAb was expressed together with P19 in different N. tabacum cultivars, all except Little Crittenden showed a marked discolouring of the infiltrated areas of the leaf and decreased antibody expression. Co‐expression of P19 also abolished antibody accumulation in crosses between N. tabacum cv. I‐64 and Little Crittenden, indicating a dominant mode of inheritance for the observed P19‐induced responses.","plant"
"BACKGROUND: Solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment is an established virus inactivation technology that has been applied in the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human plasma for more than 20 years. Data on the inactivation of enveloped viruses by S/D treatment collected from seven Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and efficacy of this virus inactivation method. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The results from 308 studies reflecting production conditions as well as technical variables significantly beyond the product release specification were evaluated for virus inactivation, comprising different combinations of solvent and detergent (tri(n‐butyl) phosphate [TNBP]/Tween 80, TNBP/Triton X‐100, TNBP/Na‐cholate) and different products (Factor [F]VIII, F IX, and intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulins). RESULTS: Neither product class, process temperature, protein concentration, nor pH value has a significant impact on virus inactivation. A variable that did appear to be critical was the concentration of solvent and detergent. CONCLUSION: The data presented here demonstrate the robustness of virus inactivation by S/D treatment for a broad spectrum of enveloped test viruses and process variables. Our data substantiate the fact that no transmission of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or of other enveloped viruses was reported for licensed plasma derivatives since the introduction of S/D treatment.","hematology"
"Objective and background:  Pathological changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suggest that SARS sequelae are associated with dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine production. To improve understanding of the immuno‐pathological processes involved in lung injury associated with SARS, the temporal changes in cytokine/chemokine profiles in the sera of SARS patients were compared with those of patients with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP), according to the degree of lung involvement. Methods:  Serum levels of 11 cytokines and chemokines, in 14 patients with SARS and 24 patients with CAP, were serially checked using a bead‐based multiassay system. Sera from 12 healthy subjects were used as normal controls. Results:  The serum levels of interferon‐γ‐inducible protein‐10 (IP‐10), IL‐2 and IL‐6 were significantly elevated during SARS infection. In patients with CAP, but not in those with SARS, the levels of interferon‐γ, IL‐10, IL‐8 and monokine induced by interferon‐γ (MIG) were significantly elevated compared with the levels in healthy controls. Among the chemokines/cytokines, IL‐6 levels correlated most strongly with radiographic scores (r = 0.62). The elevation of IP‐10 and IL‐2 antedated the development of chest involvement and reached peak levels earlier than the radiographic scores. In contrast, the dynamic changes in IL‐6, C‐reactive protein and neutrophils occurred synchronously with the changes in radiographic scores. The mean ratio of IL‐6 to IL‐10 in SARS patients (4.84; range 0.41–21) was significantly higher than that in CAP patients (2.95; range 0.02–10.57) (P = 0.04). Conclusions:  The early induction of IP‐10 and IL‐2, as well as the subsequent over‐production of IL‐6 and lack of IL‐10 production, probably contribute to the main immuno‐pathological processes involved in lung injury in SARS. These changes in cytokine/chemokine profile are remarkably different from those observed in CAP patients.","respiratory"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that cost nearly 800 lives. While there have been no recent outbreaks of the disease, the threat remains as SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) like strains still exist in animal reservoirs. Therefore, the development of a vaccine against SARS is in grave need. Here, we have designed and produced a prototypic SARS vaccine: a self‐assembling polypeptide nanoparticle that repetitively displays a SARS B‐cell epitope from the C‐terminal heptad repeat of the virus’ spike protein. Biophysical analyses with circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering confirmed the computational design showing α‐helcial nanoparticles with sizes of about 25 nm. Immunization experiments with no adjuvants were performed with BALB/c mice. An investigation of the binding properties of the elicited antibodies showed that they were highly conformation specific for the coiled‐coil epitope because they specifically recognized the native trimeric conformation of C‐terminal heptad repeat region. Consequently, the antisera exhibited neutralization activity in an in vitro infection inhibition assay. We conclude that these peptide nanoparticles represent a promising platform for vaccine design, in particular for diseases that are characterized by neutralizing epitopes with coiled‐coil conformation such as SARS‐CoV or other enveloped viruses.","chemistry"

For both MBL2 and MASP2 genes, the frequencies of polymorphisms are extremely variable between different ethnicities, and this aspect has to be carefully considered when performing genetic studies. While polymorphisms in the MBL‐encoding gene (MBL2) have been associated, depending upon ethnicity, with several diseases in different populations, little is known about the distribution of MASP2 gene polymorphisms in human populations. The aim of our study was thus to determine the frequencies of MBL2 (exon 1 and promoter) and MASP2 (p.D371Y) polymorphisms in a Brazilian population from Rio de Janeiro. A total of 294 blood donor samples were genotyped for 27 polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene by direct sequencing of a region spanning from the promoter polymorphism H/L rs11003125 to the rs1800451 polymorphism (at codon 57 in the first exon of the gene). Genotyping for MASP2 p.D371Y was carried out using fluorogenic probes. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the prevalence of the MASP2 p.D371Y polymorphism in a Brazilian population. The C allele frequency 39% is something intermediate between the reported 14% in Europeans and 90% in Sub‐Saharan Africans. MBL2 polymorphisms frequencies were quite comparable to those previously reported for admixed Brazilians. Both MBL2 and MASP2 polymorphisms frequencies reported in our study for the admixed Brazilian population are somehow intermediate between those reported in Europeans and Africans, reflecting the ethnic composition of the southern Brazilian population, estimated to derive from an admixture of Caucasian (31%), African (34%) and Native American (33%) populations. In conclusion, our population genetic study describes the frequencies of MBL2 and MASP2 functional SNPs in a population from Rio de Janeiro, with the aim of adding new information concerning the distribution of these SNPs in a previously unanalysed Brazilian population, thus providing a new genetic tool for the evaluation of the association of MBL2 and MASP2 functional SNPs with diseases in Brazil, with particular emphasis on the state of Rio de Janeiro.","immunology"
"Delivering polynucleotides into animals has been a major challenge facing their success as therapeutic agents. Given the matured understanding of antibody‐mediated delivery techniques, it is possible to rationally design delivery vehicles that circulate in the blood stream and are specifically delivered into target organs. If the targeting moiety is designed to contain the cargo of an RNAi mediator without impacting its paratope, directed delivery can be achieved. In this article, we review the state of art in delivery technology for RNA mediators and address how this technique could soon be used to enhance the efficacy of the numerous small RNA therapeutic programs currently under evaluation.

"The ability to control cellular and viral gene expression, either globally or selectively, is central to a successful viral infection, and it is also crucial for the host to respond and eradicate pathogens. In eukaryotes, regulation of message stability contributes significantly to the control of gene expression and plays a prominent role in the normal physiology of a cell as well as in its response to environmental and pathogenic stresses. Not surprisingly, emerging evidence indicates that there are significant interactions between the eukaryotic RNA turnover machinery and a wide variety of viruses. Interestingly, in many cases viruses have evolved mechanisms not only to evade eradication by these pathways, but also to manipulate them for enhanced viral replication and gene expression. Given our incomplete understanding of how many of these pathways are normally regulated, viruses should be powerful tools to help deconstruct the complex networks and events governing eukaryotic RNA stability.

"A number of different human pathogens code for their own enzymes involved in the synthesis of the RNA cap structure. Although the RNA cap structures originating from human and microbial enzymes are often identical, the subunit composition, structure and catalytic mechanisms of the microbial‐encoded enzymes involved in the synthesis of the RNA cap structure are often significantly different from those of host cells. As a consequence, these pathogenic cap‐forming enzymes are potential targets for antimicrobial drugs. During the past few years, experimental studies have started to demonstrate that inhibition of the RNA capping activity is a reasonable approach for the development of antimicrobial agents. The combination of structural, biochemical, and molecular modeling studies are starting to reveal novel molecules that can serve as starting blocks for the design of more potent and specific antimicrobial agents. Here, we examine various strategies that have been developed to inhibit microbial enzymes involved in the synthesis of the RNA cap structure, emphasizing the challenges remaining to design potent and selective drugs.

"Clinical laboratories providing an etiological diagnosis of respiratory tract infections (RTI) have increasingly relied on nucleic acid amplification tests. Polymerase chain reaction‐based methods are becoming more standardized, and several have undergone the scrutiny of regulatory agencies mandated to assess the risks and benefits of implementing pathogen‐detection assays into diagnostic algorithms. Respiratory viruses lead to both upper and lower RTI and are implicated in exacerbations of chronic pulmonary conditions. Viruses from different taxonomic families present with overlapping clinical signs and symptoms, necessitating an accurate laboratory diagnosis. The clinical utility of diagnostic algorithms incorporating tests for respiratory viruses will depend on the breadth of pathogen coverage and the time to reliable and actionable results. This review covers strategies for detecting a panel of respiratory viruses employed over the last decade that have enabled an etiological diagnosis of RTI in a cost‐effective manner.","multidisciplinary"
"Informal institutions governing the use of wild species are present in many societies. A system of prohibitions known as fady is central to Malagasy culture. We examined whether fady that relate to the use of natural resources in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar play an important conservation role. Prohibitions ranged from strict taboos in which a species or area was forbidden by the ancestors to social norms that concerned acceptable behavior when harvesting wild species. Strict taboos offered real protection to threatened species, such as the lemur Propithecus edwardsi and the carnivore Cryptoprocta ferox. Taboos also reduced pressure on some economically important endemic species by preventing their sale or limiting the harvest season. Despite their value for conservation, the taboos did not appear to originate from attempts to sustainably manage resources. Nevertheless, social norms, in which the sanction was social disapproval rather than supernatural retribution, encouraged sustainable harvesting practices for tenrecs (Tenrec ecudatus) and pandans (Pandanus spp.). Unfortunately, the social norms concerning methods of harvesting pandans appeared to be breaking down in villages surrounding Ranomafana National Park, and we suggest that the imposition of external conservation rules is weakening traditional management. Informal institutions are important to conservation because they suggest ways of improving cultural understanding and conservation communication. Food taboos influence societal preferences, which affect the wider demand for a species. Most important, where capacity to enforce external conservation rules is limited, informal institutions may provide the only effective regulations. Informal institutions should receive greater attention from conservation biologists so that local people's conservation roles can be acknowledged fairly and so that potential synergies with conservation objectives can be realized.","environmental"
"A highly effective strategy for combating infectious diseases is to enhance host defenses using immunomodulators, either preventatively, through vaccination, or therapeutically. The effectiveness of many vaccines currently in use is due in part to adjuvants, molecules that have little immunogenicity by themselves but which help enhance and appropriately skew the immune response to an antigen. The development of new vaccines necessitates the development of new types of adjuvants to ensure an appropriate immune response. Herein, we review commonly used vaccine adjuvants and discuss promising adjuvant candidates. We also discuss various other immunomodulators (namely cytokines, Toll‐like receptor agonists, and host defense peptides) that are, or have potential to be, useful for antimicrobial therapies that exert their effects by boosting host immune responses rather than targeting pathogens directly.","multidisciplinary"
"The helicase from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) possesses NTPase, duplex RNA/DNA‐unwinding and RNA‐capping activities that are essential for viral replication and proliferation. Here, we have isolated DNA aptamers against the SARS‐CoV helicase from a combinatorial DNA library. These aptamers show two distinct classes of secondary structure, G‐quadruplex and non‐G‐quadruplex, as shown by circular dichroism and gel electrophoresis. All of the aptamers that were selected stimulated ATPase activity of the SARS‐CoV helicase with low‐nanomolar apparent Km values. Intriguingly, only the non‐G‐quadruplex aptamers showed specific inhibition of helicase activities, whereas the G‐quadruplex aptamers did not inhibit helicase activities. The non‐G‐quadruplex aptamer with the strongest inhibitory potency was modified at the 3′‐end with biotin or inverted thymidine, and the modification increased its stability in serum, particularly for the inverted thymidine modification. Structural diversity in selection coupled to post‐selection stabilisation has provided new insights into the aptamers that were selected for a helicase target. These aptamers are being further developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV replication.","chemistry"
"Abstract.  This paper describes our studies on non‐parametric maximum‐likelihood estimators in a semiparametric mixture model for competing‐risks data, in which proportional hazards models are specified for failure time models conditional on cause and a multinomial model is specified for the marginal distribution of cause conditional on covariates. We provide a verifiable identifiability condition and, based on it, establish an asymptotic profile likelihood theory for this model. We also provide efficient algorithms for the computation of the non‐parametric maximum‐likelihood estimate and its asymptotic variance. The success of this method is demonstrated in simulation studies and in the analysis of Taiwan severe acute respiratory syndrome data.","statistics"
"The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) is an important issue for treatment and prevention of SARS. Previously, SARS CoV 3C‐like protease (3CLpro) has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis via the activation of caspase‐3 and caspase‐9 (Lin, C. W., Lin, K. H., Hsieh, T. H., Shiu, S. Y. et al., FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2006, 46, 375–380). In this study, proteome analysis of the human promonocyte HL‐CZ cells expressing SARS CoV 3CLpro was performed using 2‐DE and nanoscale capillary LC/ESI quadrupole‐TOF MS. Functional classification of identified up‐regulated proteins indicated that protein metabolism and modification, particularly in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, was the main biological process occurring in SARS CoV 3CLpro‐expressing cells. Thirty‐six percent of identified up‐regulated proteins were located in the mitochondria, including apoptosis‐inducing factor, ATP synthase beta chain and cytochrome c oxidase. Interestingly, heat shock cognate 71‐kDa protein (HSP70), which antagonizes apoptosis‐inducing factor was shown to down‐regulate and had a 5.29‐fold decrease. In addition, confocal image analysis has shown release of mitochondrial apoptogenic apoptosis‐inducing factor and cytochrome c into the cytosol. Our results revealed that SARS CoV 3CLpro could be considered to induce mitochondrial‐mediated apoptosis. The study provides system‐level insights into the interaction of SARS CoV 3CLpro with host cells, which will be helpful in elucidating the molecular basis of SARS CoV pathogenesis.","biochemistry"
"Influenza‐like illness can be caused by a wide range of respiratory viruses. In order to investigate the epidemiology of viral pathogens related to influenza‐like illness in children of Wuhan, the largest city in central China, throat swab samples were collected from 1,472 young patients, from July 2008 to June 2010, before and after the occurrence of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1). It was found that 923 patients (62.7%) were positive for at least 1 virus and 90 patients (9.8%) were detected for multiple (≥2) respiratory viruses by real‐time PCR detection of 16 viruses. Seasonal influenza A virus was the predominant pathogen among all the 16 viruses with a positive rate of 13.3% (196/1,472), which was followed by pH1N1 (159/1,472). It was also noted that the viral distribution pattern in Wuhan changed upon the introduction of the pH1N1 virus. J. Med. Virol. 84:672–678, 2012. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","virology"
"Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is an enveloped positive‐sense RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family, which also includes the porcine pathogen PRRSV and is genetically and structurally related to the coronaviruses. EAV is an important equine pathogen that has caused significant economic losses to the horse‐breeding industry and has been difficult to control. The EAV virion consists of a genome‐containing nucleocapsid core made of nucleocapsid (N) protein surrounded by a lipid envelope containing several membrane proteins. Here, the crystal structure of the capsid‐forming domain of the EAV N protein is presented at 2.0 Å resolution. The dimeric N‐­protein structure is similar to the previously determined structure of the N protein from PRRSV, with most differences localized to the terminal helices and flexible loops. The N protein is organized as dimers of dimers in the crystal, which may reflect the arrangement of the protein in the viral nucleocapsid.","crystallography"
"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been shown to induce cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) expression in human neuroblastoma SK‐N‐SH cells through the action of MAPKs, NF‐κB, and AP‐1. On the other hand, the transcription factor CREB has also been implicated in the expression of COX‐2 in other cell lines. Here, we report that EV71‐induced COX‐2 expression and PGE2 production were both inhibited by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 or by transfection with CREB siRNA. In addition, EV71‐induced COX‐2 expression and c‐Src/EGFR phosphorylation were both attenuated by transfection with c‐Src siRNA or pretreatment with the inhibitors of c‐Src (PP1) or EGF receptor (EGFR) (AG1478 and EGFR‐neutralizing antibody). We also observed that EV71‐induced p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation was decreased following pretreatment with AG1478. Moreover, EV71‐induced COX‐2 expression was blocked by pretreatment with the p300 inhibitor GR343 or by transfection with p300 siRNA. Using immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we observed that EV71 stimulated the association of CREB and p300 with the COX‐2 promoter region. Notably, we also demonstrated that EV71‐induced COX‐2 expression and PGE2 production promoted viral replication via cAMP signaling. In summary, this study demonstrates that EV71 activates the c‐Src/EGFR/p42/p44 MAPK pathway in human SK‐N‐SH cell, which leads to the activation of CREB/p300, and stimulates COX‐2 expression and PGE2 release.

"Aims and objectives: To explore the difficulties and strategies regarding guideline implementation among emergency nurses. Background: Emerging infectious diseases remain an underlying source of global health concern. Guidelines for accident and emergency departments would require adjustments for infectious disease management. However, disparities between guidelines and nurses' practice are frequently reported, which undermines the implementation of these guidelines into practice. This article explores the experience of frontline emergency nurses regarding guideline implementation and provides an in‐depth account of their strategies in bridging guideline‐practice gaps. Design: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Methods: Semi‐structured, face‐to‐face, individual interviews were conducted between November 2013–May 2014. A purposive sample of 12 frontline emergency nurses from five accident and emergency departments in Hong Kong were recruited. The audio‐recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed with a qualitative content analysis approach. Results: Four key categories associated with guideline‐practice gaps emerged, including getting work done, adapting to accelerated infection control measures, compromising care standards and resolving competing clinical judgments across collaborating departments. The results illustrate that the guideline‐practice gaps could be associated with inadequate provision of corresponding organisational supports after guidelines are established. Conclusions: The nurses' experiences have uncovered the difficulties in the implementation of guidelines in emergency care settings and the corresponding strategies used to address these problems. The nurses' experiences reflect their endeavour in adjusting accordingly and adapting themselves to their circumstances in the face of unfeasible guidelines. Relevance to clinical practice: It is important to customise guidelines to the needs of frontline nurses. Maintaining cross‐departmental consensus on guideline interpretation and operation is also indicated as an important component for effective guideline implementation.","nursing"

"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) has been detected in the blood of infected individuals, which may have the potential to contaminate donated blood and plasma‐derived products in the event of a future outbreak. Effective methods for inactivating the SARS‐CoV in protein solutions are described in this report. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Heat, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, octanoic acid, and solvent/detergent (S/D) methods were tested individually for their ability to inactivate SARS‐CoV in protein solutions appropriately mimicking blood‐derived products. Treated samples were tested for inactivation in a tissue culture growth assay. RESULTS: Viral inactivation by heat treatment at 60°C required 15 to 30 minutes to inactivate the SARS‐CoV. UVC efficiently inactivated SARS‐CoV in 40 minutes, whereas UVA required the addition of psoralen to enhance inactivation of the virus. The presence of bovine serum albumin limited the ability of UVC and UVA to inactivate SARS‐CoV and octanoic acid treatment does not reduce the infectivity of SARS‐CoV–spiked protein solutions. S/D treatment required 2, 4, and up to 24 hours for Triton X‐100, Tween 80, and sodium cholate inactivation, respectively. CONCLUSION: Heat, UVC irradiation, and S/D treatments effectively inactivate SARS‐CoV, whereas octanoic acid treatment is insufficient for inactivation of the virus.","hematology"
"Objectives. After two outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from March–June 2003, we reviewed the unexpected role and responsibilities of pharmacists during these two crises, and present strategies for better crisis preparedness. Methods and Results. Pharmacists were actively involved in battling the SARS crises. After conducting extensive literature searches and evaluations, pharmacists prepared administration and dosing guidelines for the two investigational drugs, ribavirin and interferon alfacon‐1, that were being used to treat the syndrome. They provided direct patient care under modified conditions. They revised drug distribution procedures and developed new ones to meet more stringent infection‐control standards. Collaborative teamwork with key stakeholders was important in accomplishing tasks in an efficient and timely manner. Regular communication with health care staff took place internally and externally. Education and updated information for pharmacists was crucial. Conclusion. Pharmacists can play a vital role during crises in the areas of drug distribution, drug information, and direct patient care. Collaborative teamwork and close communication are keys to success. Pharmacists must be proactive and take a leadership role in assuming pharmacy‐related responsibilities. By evaluating what worked and what didn't, pharmacists can develop procedures for future crises requiring pharmacy support.","pharmacology"
"Recent outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, have motivated the research for accurate, rapid diagnostics that can be administered at the point of care. Nucleic acid biomarkers for these diseases can be amplified and quantified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In order to solve the problems of conventional PCR—speed, uniform heating and cooling, and massive metal heating blocks—an innovative optofluidic cavity PCR method using light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) is accomplished. Using this device, 30 thermal cycles between 94 °C and 68 °C can be accomplished in 4 min for 1.3 μL (10 min for 10 μL). Simulation results show that temperature differences across the 750 μm thick cavity are less than 2 °C and 0.2 °C, respectively, at 94 °C and 68 °C. Nucleic acid concentrations as low as 10–8 ng μL–1 (2 DNA copies per μL) can be amplified with 40 PCR thermal cycles. This simple, ultrafast, precise, robust, and low‐cost optofluidic cavity PCR is favorable for advanced molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. It is especially important for the development of lightweight, point‐of‐care devices for use in both developing and developed countries.","nanoscience"
"We investigated the reactions between substituted α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds (Michael systems) and thiols by computations as well as chemoassays. The results give insight into variations in the underlying mechanisms as a function of the substitution pattern. This is of interest for the mechanisms of inhibition of the SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS‐CoV Mpro) by etacrynic acid derivatives as well as for the excess toxicity of substituted α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds. This study compares possible reaction courses including 1,4‐addition followed by a ketonization step, and underscores the importance of a base‐catalyzed step for the reactivity of thiol groups in enzymes. Phenyl and methyl substituents at the Michael system decrease the reactivity of the electrophilic compound, but chlorophenyl substituents partly recover the reactivity. Computations also indicate that electron‐pushing substituents lead to a change in the reaction mechanism. The conformation of the Michael system is also found to significantly influence reactivity: the s‐cis conformation leads to higher reactivity than the s‐trans conformation. The computed data explain the trends in measured inhibition potencies of substituted α,β‐unsaturated carbonyl compounds and of reaction rates in chemical assays. They also indicate that the reversibility of inhibition does not stand in contrast to the formation of a new covalent bond between inhibitor and protease.","pharmacology"
"The genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae includes the Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) which were discovered in the 1990s in Australia and Malaysia, respectively, after emerging to cause severe and often fatal outbreaks in humans and animals. While HeV is confined to Australia, more recent NiV outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. The clinical manifestations of both henipaviruses in humans appear similar, with a predominance of an acute encephalitic syndrome. Likewise, the pathological features are similar and characterized by disseminated, multi‐organ vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection/ulceration, vasculitis, vasculitis‐induced thrombosis/occlusion, parenchymal ischemia/microinfarction, and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system (CNS), lung, kidney and other major organs. This unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis‐induced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the CNS. Both viruses can also cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection. Many animal models studied to date have largely confirmed the pathology of henipavirus infection, and provided the means to test new therapeutic agents and vaccines. As the bat is the natural host of henipaviruses and has worldwide distribution, spillover events into human populations are expected to occur in the future.","pathology"

"Exosomes are small 30–100 nm membrane vesicles released from hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells and function to promote intercellular communication. They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present in exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. This study used LC‐MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present in exosomes released from M. tuberculosis‐infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFPs) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP‐treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present in exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis‐infected cells. The exosomes from CFP‐treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of naïve T cells in vivo. These results suggest that exosomes containing M. tuberculosis antigens may be alternative approach to developing a tuberculosis vaccine.","biochemistry"
"Cancer progression is accompanied by increased levels of extracellular proteases that are capable of remodeling the extracellular matrix, as well as cleaving and activating growth factors and receptors that are involved in pro‐cancerous signaling pathways. Several members of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family have been shown to play critical roles in cancer progression, however, the expression or function of the TTSP Human Airway Trypsin‐like protease (HAT) in carcinogenesis has not been examined. In the present study we aimed to determine the expression of HAT during squamous cell carcinogenesis. HAT transcript is present in several tissues containing stratified squamous epithelium and decreased expression is observed in carcinomas. We determined that HAT protein is consistently expressed on the cell surface in suprabasal/apical layers of squamous cells in healthy cervical and esophageal epithelia. To assess whether HAT protein is differentially expressed in normal tissue versus tissue in different stages of carcinogenesis, we performed a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of HAT protein expression levels and localization in arrays of paraffin embedded human cervical and esophageal carcinomas compared to the corresponding normal tissue. We found that HAT protein is expressed in the non‐proliferating, differentiated cellular strata and is lost during the dedifferentiation of epithelial cells, a hallmark of squamous cell carcinogenesis. Thus, HAT expression may potentially be useful as a marker for clinical grading and assessment of patient prognosis in squamous cell carcinomas. J. Cell.

"Objective – The aim of this review is to describe and evaluate both conventional and molecular diagnostic testing utilized in dogs and cats with acute neurologic diseases. Various types of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are explored along with novel molecular diagnostic testing that ultimately may prove useful in the critical care setting. Data Sources – PUBMED was searched to obtain relevant references material using keywords: ‘canine OR feline meningitis AND meningoencephalitis,’‘feline infectious peritonitis,’‘canine distemper,’‘canine OR feline AND toxoplasma,’‘canine neospora,’‘canine OR feline AND rickettsia,’‘granulomatous meningoencephalitis,’‘steroid responsive meningitis arteritis,’‘necrotizing encephalitis,’‘novel neurodiagnostics,’‘canine OR feline AND CNS borrelia,’‘canine OR feline AND CNS bartonella,’‘canine OR feline AND CNS fungal,’‘nested OR multiplex OR degenerate OR consensus OR CODEHOP AND PCR.’ Research findings from the authors' laboratory and current veterinary textbooks also were utilized. Human Data Synthesis – Molecular diagnostic testing including conventional, real‐time, and consensus and degenerate PCR and microarray analysis are utilized routinely for the antemortem diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis (ME) in humans. Recently, PCR using consensus degenerate hybrid primers (CODEHOP) has been used to identify and characterize a number of novel human viruses. Veterinary Data Synthesis – Molecular diagnostic testing such as conventional and real‐time PCR aid in the diagnosis of several important central nervous system infectious agents including canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, rickettsial species, and others. Recently, broadly reactive consensus and degenerate PCR reactions have been applied to canine ME including assays for rickettsial organisms, Borrelia spp. and Bartonella spp., and various viral families. Conclusions – In the acute neurologic patient, there are several key infectious diseases that can be pursued by a combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic testing. It is important that the clinician understands the utility, as well as the limitations, of the various neurodiagnostic tests that are available.","veterinary"
"A high‐throughput antagonistic assay was developed to screen for bacterial isolates capable of controlling the maize fungal phytopathogen Fusarium verticillioides. This assay combines a straightforward methodology, in which the fungus is challenged with bacterial isolates in liquid medium, with a novel approach that uses the plant lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) coupled to a fluorophore (Alexa‐Fluor® 488) under the commercial name of WGA, Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate. The assay is performed in a 96‐well plate format, which reduces the required laboratory space and streamlines quantitation and automation of the process, making it fast and accurate. The basis of our assay is that fungal biomass can be assessed by WGA, Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate staining, which recognizes the chitin in the fungal cell wall and thus permits the identification of potential antagonistic bacteria that inhibit fungal growth. This principle was validated by chitin‐competition binding assays against WGA, Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate; confocal laser microscopy confirmed that the fluorescent WGA, Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate binds to the chitin of the fungal cell wall. The majority of bacterial isolates did not bind to the WGA, Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate. Furthermore, including washing steps significantly reduced any bacterial staining to background levels, even in the rare cases where bacterial isolates were capable of binding to WGA. Confirmatory conventional agar plate antagonistic assays were also conducted to validate our technique. We are now successfully employing this large‐scale antagonistic assay as a pre‐screening step for potential fungal antagonists in extensive bacteria collections (on the order of thousands of isolates).","microbiology"
"Sawfish are among the world's most threatened and understudied marine fishes. There are few studies on sawfish from outside Australian and USA waters ‐ a significant knowledge gap considering their circumtropical distribution and migratory nature. This paper presents the first assessment of sawfish exploitation and status in Bangladesh: a country that is subject to extensive fishing efforts, and home to the largest mangrove forest on Earth – an ecosystem that provides critical nursery habitat for juvenile sawfish. A countrywide rapid assessment was undertaken between December 2011 and November 2012, using an interdisciplinary methodology. Fish landing stations, dry fish markets, and fishing villages were visited and a sawfish medicine maker was found and interviewed. In addition, interviews with national specialists at academic and fisheries institutions were undertaken. In total, 203 questionnaire surveys were conducted with fishers and traders in order to understand the extent of decline, potential drivers of declines, and local perceptions and uses of sawfish. Eighteen rostra were documented from museum archives and private collections, and unpublished data were sourced. Two sawfish species, Pristis pristis and Anoxypristis cuspidata were confirmed to be present in Bangladesh. General population declines were revealed. The average annual sawfish encounter rate (observations and catches) declined from 3.7 individuals using lifetime recall data (~22‐year), to 1.5 using 5‐year recall data, and further to 0.7 using 1‐year recall data. The consensus from social research methods was that sawfish were caught as bycatch, with drift gill nets being cited as the most damaging gear type. Every respondent perceived sawfish as a useful animal – typically for medicinal or cultural values. Conservation measures are proposed, including a local education and outreach programme to seek behavioural changes – primarily to release live sawfish.

"The Notch signaling pathway plays important roles in a variety of cellular processes. Aberrant transduction of Notch signaling contributes to many diseases and cancers in humans. The Notch receptor intracellular domain, the activated form of Notch receptor, is extremely difficult to detect in normal cells. However, it can activate signaling at very low protein concentration to elicit its biological effects. In the present study, a cell based luciferase reporter gene assay was established in K562 cells to screen drugs which could modulate the endogenous CBF1‐dependent Notch signal pathway. Using this system, we found that the luciferase activity of CBF1‐dependent reporter gene was activated by baicalin and baicalein but suppressed by niclosamide in both dose‐ and time‐dependent manners. Treatment with these drugs modulated endogenous Notch signaling and affected mRNA expression levels of Notch1 receptor and Notch target genes in K562 cells. Additionally, erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was suppressed by baicalin and baicalein yet was promoted by niclosamide. Colony‐forming ability in soft agar was decreased after treatment with baicalin and baicalein, but was not affected in the presence of niclosamide. Thus, modulation of Notch signaling after treatment with any of these three drugs may affect tumorigenesis of K562 cells suggesting that these drugs may have therapeutic potential for those tumors associated with Notch signaling. Taken together, this system could be beneficial for screening of drugs with potential to treat Notch signal pathway‐associated diseases. J. Cell.

Transport proteins catalyse the uptake and exchange of ions, substrates, intermediates, products and cofactors across membranes. Given the large number of metabolites, a wide spectrum of transporters is required. The vast majority of in silico annotated membrane transporters in plant genomes, however, has not yet been functionally characterised. Hence, to understand the metabolic network as a whole, it is important to understand how transporters connect and control the metabolic pathways of plant cells. Heterologous expression and in vitro activity studies of recombinant transport proteins have highly improved their functional analysis in the last two decades. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in membrane protein expression and functional characterisation using various host systems and transport assays.","plant"
"The longer and neurotoxic species of amyloid‐β protein (Aβ), Aβ42 and Aβ43, contribute to Aβ accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and are considered to be the primary cause of the disease. In contrast, the predominant secreted form of Aβ, Aβ40, inhibits amyloid deposition and may have neuroprotective effects. We have reported that angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) converts Aβ42 to Aβ40 and that Aβ43 is the earliest‐depositing Aβ species in the amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse brain. Here we found that Aβ43 can be converted to Aβ42 and to Aβ40 in mouse brain lysate. We further identified the brain Aβ43‐to‐Aβ42‐converting enzyme as ACE2. The purified human ACE2 converted Aβ43 to Aβ42, and this activity was inhibited by a specific ACE2 inhibitor, DX600. Notably, the combination of ACE2 and ACE could convert Aβ43 to Aβ40. Our results indicate that the longer, neurotoxic forms of Aβ can be converted to the shorter, less toxic or neuroprotective forms of Aβ by ACE2 and ACE. Moreover, we found that ACE2 activity showed a tendency to decrease in the serum of AD patients compared with normal controls, suggesting an association between lower ACE2 activity and AD. Thus, maintaining brain ACE2 and ACE activities may be important for preventing brain amyloid neurotoxicity and deposition in Alzheimer's disease. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","neurosciences"
"An isolate from a patient in the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore was used to infect Vero E6 cells. This study concentrated on the first 30 min of infection. It was discovered that the SARS coronavirus attached, entered, and uncoated the nucleocapsids, all within a 30‐min period. At 5 min after infection, several virus particles lined the Vero cell plasma membrane. Virus particles were at various stages of fusion at the cell surface, since entry was not a synchronised process. After entry (10 and 15 min), spherical core particles moved into the cytoplasm within large vacuoles. Quite surprising at such early stages of infection (20 min), a virus‐induced change in the infected cells was evident. The induction of myelin‐like membrane whorls was obvious within the same vacuoles as the core particles. The significance of this virus‐induced change is unknown at this stage. By 25–30 min postinfection (p.i.), the spherical core particles appeared to be disassociating and, in their place, doughnut‐shaped electron‐dense structures were observed. These could be the virus genomes together with the helical nucleocapsids. They were no longer in large vacuoles but packaged into smaller vacuoles in the cytoplasm, and occasionally in small groups.

"Reference genes are generally employed in real‐time quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR) experiments to normalize variability between different samples. The aim of this study was to identify and validate appropriate reference genes as internal controls for RT‐qPCR experiments in rubella virus (RV)‐infected Vero and MCF‐7 cell lines using SYBR green fluorescence. The software programs geNorm and NormFinder and the ΔΔCt calculation were used to determine the expression stability and thus reliability of nine suitable reference genes. HPRT1 and HUEL, and HUEL and TBP were identified to be most suitable for RT‐qPCR analysis of RV‐infected Vero and MCF‐7 cells, respectively. These genes were used as normalizers for transcriptional activity of selected cellular genes. The results confirm previously published microarray and Northern blot data, particularly on the transcriptional activity of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the nuclear body protein SP100. Furthermore, the mRNA level of the mitochondrial protein p32 is increased in RV‐infected cells. The effect on cellular gene transcription by RV‐infection seems to be cell line‐specific, but genes of central importance for viral life cycle appear to be altered to a similar degree. This study does not only provide an accurate and flexible tool for the quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in RV‐infected cell lines. It also indicates, that the suitability of a reference gene as normalizer of RT‐qPCR data and the host‐cell response to RV‐infection are strictly cell‐line specific. J. Cell.

"A hybridization‐based genosensor is designed on a disposable gold nanostructured screen‐printed carbon electrode. Gold nanoparticles which are formed in situ by applying a constant current intensity during a fixed time, acts as an immobilization and transduction surface. The parameters affecting the methodology are studied, with special attention being placed on sensibility. Immobilization takes place through thiol‐gold interaction in a relatively fast way, and the genosensor response is found to be linearly to the biotinylated target concentration between 2.5 and 50 pmol/L; a detection limit of 2.5 pmol/L is calculated, and a sensitivity of 1.76 μA/pmol L−1 is achieved. These results improve significantly those described in literature, thus demonstrating the advantages offered by the use of gold‐nanostructured surfaces.","electrochemistry"
"Positive strand RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of an infected cell and encode nucleocapsid proteins. These proteins function to promote encapsidation of the RNA genome and virus particle assembly as well as playing potential roles in viral RNA synthesis. Nucleocapsid proteins can also associate with cellular proteins and signaling cascades. The arterivirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is no exception and localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus in virus‐infected cells. This study generated an interactome map of the N protein from a highly virulent North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). This is a major pathogen of swine resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Crucial to the study was the use of SILAC coupled to affinity purification using GFP‐traps and LC‐MS/MS. This approach has not been applied before to the investigation of host/viral protein interactomes and this study revealed that the PRRSV N protein interacts with the host cell protein synthesis machinery especially at the level of translation initiation as well as with the RNA post‐transcriptional modification machinery. Applications of the dataset can include studies of virus/host interactions and the design of live attenuated recombinant vaccines.","biochemistry"
"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major etiological agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). Several recent outbreaks of HFMD in East Asia were associated with neurological complications and numerous deaths. In 2000, an outbreak in Singapore afflicted thousands of children, resulting in four fatal cases from whom EV71 was isolated. The virus possesses four structural proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, each of which is involved in forming the pentameric icosahedral structure of the virus. Here we report that the full‐length VP1 structural protein of EV71 is capable of self‐association. Dimerization of VP1 was tested using the yeast two‐hybrid system, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, in vitro coupled transcription‐translation binding assays, and mammalian cell transcription‐translation experiments. Dimerization of various truncated versions of the VP1 protein was also studied by mutational analysis. Systematic deletions of parts of VP1 revealed that the region spanning amino acids 66–132 of VP1 contains the major dimerization domain. However, the region between amino acids 132 and 297 was indispensable, and contributed largely to increasing the strength of the interaction. This ability of EV71 VP1 to self‐associate and to participate significantly in forming the characteristic icosahedral capsid strongly enhances the pathogenicity and stability of the virus to withstand the environment of the gastrointestinal tract.

"Aim:  As antibiotics are generally not recommended for the treatment of acute sore throat, the availability of clinically efficacious, over‐the‐counter (OTC) treatment alternatives is becoming increasingly important. This study was designed to determine the analgesic properties of amylmetacresol and 2,4‐dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA) throat lozenges (Strepsils®) in the relief of acute sore throat caused by upper respiratory tract infections. Methods:  Patients (n = 310) were randomly assigned to receive AMC/DCBA throat lozenges (n = 155) or non‐medicated placebo lozenges (n = 155). After baseline assessments, patients completed three rating assessments at 10 timepoints from 5 to 20 min after first dose. Subsequent lozenges were taken as required, and assessments were made at the end of Day 1, 24 h after first dose, and at the end of Days 2 and 3. Analgesic properties were assessed by comparing severity of throat soreness and sore throat relief ratings. Difficulty in swallowing and functional impairment scores were also assessed. Results:  Amylmetacresol/DCBA throat lozenges reduced throat soreness at 5 min after first dose, which persisted for 2 h and was significantly different vs. non‐medicated lozenges at all assessment timepoints for the duration of the 3‐day study. Similar significant effects were observed with sore throat relief, easing of difficulty with swallowing and functional impairment scores. There were no differences in adverse events reported between treatment groups. Conclusion:  Amylmetacresol/DCBA throat lozenges provide rapid analgesic effects that last for 2 h, providing ongoing relief long after the lozenge has dissolved. The superior analgesic effects and improvements in functional impairment scores observed with AMC/DCBA throat lozenges translate into pain relief benefits that are clinically meaningful and are thus a suitable OTC treatment option for patients in the self‐management of acute sore throat.","medicine"
"A 39‐year‐old African‐American woman was referred to the department of dermatology, Mount Sinal Hospital, New York for evaluation of a skin lesion on her scalp which had been present for 3 years and had recently changed in appearance. On examination, she was found to have erythematous plaques with hair loss extending from the frontal hairline on the right side in a “C‐shaped” distribution, terminating behind the left ear. Two years later the lesion had rapidly extended to the vertex of the scalp and left temporal area (Fig. 1). There was a 10 cm × 12 cm area of alopecia at the vertex with slight erythema, but there was no evidence of scarring, inflammation or nodularity of the scalp (Fig. 2). A skin biopsy taken from the forehead revealed granulomatous dermatitis showing noncaseating granuloma with negative acid fast bacilli (AFBC) and ammonical‐silverstain for fungus (GMS) (Fig. 3). Erythematous plaque with hair loss on the left temporal area Nonscarring alopecia at the vertex with slight erythema Noncaseating granuloma consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells and multinucleated giant cells (hematoxylin and eosin staining; magnification ×100) She complained of chronic nasal congestion for 8 months. Nasal cavity examination and laryngeal endoscopy showed multiple nodules on the nasal septum and vocal cord. At that time, a presumptive diagnosis of sarcoidal nodule of the nasal septum and vocal cord was made and corticosteroids were administered orally. A chest X‐ray demonstrated prominence of the right peritracheal and perihilar regions consistent with sarcoid. A 67 Gallium scan disclosed increased uptake in the lung and perihilar lymph nodes. A skull X‐ray showed soft tissue density of the skull, probably indicating a subcutaneous sarcoidal nodule. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of her brain and skull base showed a soft tissue mass along the outer table of the calvarium within the frontal region. Six years ago, she experienced visual changes: blurred vision, tearing, floaters on both eyes and a 1 cm × 1 cm subcutaneous, painful, firm mass on the lateral side of her left upper eyelid. A skin biopsy was performed in another hospital and revealed noncaseating granuloma. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis involving the central nervous system, lacrimal gland, nasal septum, vocal cord, lung and scalp was made, and the patient was treated with 20 mg of methylprednisone on alternate days with intralesional triamcinolone injection for skin lesions. During the follow‐up period, nasal, laryngeal, pulmonary, ocular and cutaneous lesions were slightly improved and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning will be carried out for further evaluation of the brain lesion.","dermatology"
"Papain‐like protease (PLpro) is one of two cysteine proteases involved in the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). PLpro also shows significant in vitro deubiquitinating and de‐ISGylating activities, although the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the crystal structure of SARS‐CoV PLpro C112S mutant in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) is reported at 1.4 Å resolution. The Ub core makes mostly hydrophilic interactions with PLpro, while the Leu‐Arg‐Gly‐Gly C‐terminus of Ub is located in the catalytic cleft of PLpro, mimicking the P4–P1 residues and providing the first atomic insights into its catalysis. One of the O atoms of the C‐terminal Gly residue of Ub is located in the oxyanion hole consisting of the main‐chain amides of residues 112 and 113. Mutations of residues in the PLpro–Ub interface lead to reduced catalytic activity, confirming their importance for Ub binding and/or catalysis. The structure also revealed an N‐cyclohexyl‐2‐aminethanesulfonic acid molecule near the catalytic triad, and kinetic studies suggest that this binding site is also used by other PLpro inhibitors. Overall, the structure provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coronaviral PLpro catalysis.","crystallography"
"The human collectin, mannose‐binding lectin (MBL), is an important protein of the humoral innate immune system. With multiple carbohydrate‐recognition domains, it is able to bind to sugar groups displayed on the surfaces of a wide range of microorganisms and thereby provide first‐line defence. Importantly, it also activates the complement system through a distinctive third pathway, independent of both antibody and the C1 complex. Three single point mutations in exon 1 of the expressed human MBL‐2 gene appear to impair the generation of functional oligomers. Such deficiencies of functional protein are common in certain populations, e.g. in sub‐Saharan Africa, but virtually absent in others, e.g. indigenous Australians. MBL disease association studies have been a fruitful area of research and implicate a role for MBL in infective, inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes. Overall, there appears to be a genetic balance in which individuals generally benefit from high levels of the protein. However, in certain situations, reduced levels of circulating MBL may be beneficial to the host and this may explain the persistence of the deleterious gene polymorphisms in many population groups.","pathology"
"Rapid detection of viral pathogens is crucial for antiviral therapy. High‐density 60–70‐mer oligonucleotide microarrays have been explored for broad detection of many viruses. However, relatively low specificity and the complex analytical processes are the major limitations when pan‐viral oligonucleotide microarrays are used to detect viral pathogens. In this study, genus‐specific oligonucleotides were used as probes and modified sample preparations were carried out to improve the specificity and accuracy of the pan‐viral oligonucleotide microarray. Genus‐specific 63‐mer oligonucleotide probes were used for screening human pathogenic RNA viruses. A total of 628 oligonucleotide probes covering 32 RNA viral genera from 14 viral families were used. The number of oligonucleotide probes was decreased to simplify the analytical process of hybridization and to minimize cross‐hybridization. Host genomes were removed by DNase I/RNase T1 digestion before viral nucleic acid extraction, and non‐ribosomal hexanucleotides were used for reverse transcription to minimize interference of host genomes. Cultured viruses were used for microarray validation. The microarray was validated by cultured isolates that belonged to five viral genera. By using DNase I/RNase T1 digestion before viral nucleic acid extraction and non‐ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription, the specificity of the microarray was improved. Furthermore, the analytical process of hybridization results was simplified. The specificity of pan‐viral microarray could be improved by using genus‐specific oligonucleotides as probes and by using non‐ribosomal hexanucleotides for reverse transcription. Combined with subsequent degenerate reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction and sequencing processes, this improved genus‐specific oligonucleotides microarray provides a relatively flexible strategy for diagnosis of RNA virus diseases.

"Polyomavirus BK is a recognized cause of nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis in kidney or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. This study explored a role of genetic variations in capsid protein VP‐1 gene as a factor in viral pathogenesis. VP‐1 was amplified from 7 healthy subjects with viruria, 7 transplant patients with viruria, and 11 patients with viremia or nephropathy. PCR products were cloned and a total of 558 clonal sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using standard methods. VP‐1 quasispecies were found in 25/25 and coinfection with different genotypes in 12/25 subjects. Genotype II was found as an unexpected minority species in 5/25 individuals. Recombinant strains of uncertain biologic significance, which frequently contained genotype II and IV sequences were identified in 9/25 subjects. Viremia/nephropathy group was characterized by (a) greater sequence complexity in whole VP‐1 versus BC loop and BC loop compared to the HI loop, (b) greater intra‐strain genetic diversity in the BC loop compared to whole VP‐1 protein and HI loop, (c) more non‐synonymous substitutions (dN) in the BC loop compared to whole VP‐1 and HI loop, (e) fewer synonymous substitutions (dS) compared to healthy‐viruria group, and (f) selection pressure (dN/dS >1.0) exerted on VP‐1. In conclusion, this study documents frequent occurrence of quasispecies in a host DNA polymerase dependent virus, which is theoretically expected to show high replication fidelity. Quasispecies occur even in healthy subjects with viruria, but evolutionary selection pressure directed at the viral capsid protein (VP‐1) is seen only in patients with viremia or nephropathy. J. Med.

"BACKGROUND: Plasma fractionators have implemented many improvements over the past decade directed toward reducing the likelihood of pathogen transmission by purified blood products, yet little has been published attempting to assess the overall impact of these improvements on the probability of safety of the final product. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Safety margins for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), parvovirus B19, and variant form of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (vCJD) were calculated for the two fibrin sealants licensed in the United States and for thrombin. These products were selected because their use in a clinical setting is, in most cases, optional, and both were relatively recently approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Moreover, thrombin and fibrinogen both undergo two dedicated virus inactivation steps and/or removal steps in accord with the recommendations of regulatory agencies worldwide. Safety margins were determined by comparing the potential maximum viral loads in contaminated units to viral clearance factors, ultimately leading to the calculation of the residual risk per vial. RESULTS: The residual risk of pathogen transmission per vial was calculated to be less than 1 in 10−15 for HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV for both fibrinogen and thrombin. Owing to the greater quantities that can be present and its greater thermal stability, the calculated risk for parvovirus transmission was 1 in 500,000 vials for fibrinogen and less than 1 in 107 per vial for thrombin. Assuming that vCJD is found to be present in plasma donations, its risk of transmission by these purified and processed plasma derivatives would appear to be very low. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen safety initiatives implemented by plasma fractionators over the past 10 to 20 years have resulted in products with excellent pathogen safety profiles. Of the agents examined, parvovirus continues to have the lowest calculated margin of safety. Despite this, parvovirus transmissions should be rare. Manufacturers are encouraged to continue exploring processes to further enlarge parvovirus safety margins and to continue exploring ways of eliminating prions.","hematology"
"Viral infections are associated with coagulation disorders. All aspects of the coagulation cascade, primary hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis, can be affected. As a consequence, thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemorrhage, or both, may occur. Investigation of coagulation disorders as a consequence of different viral infections have not been performed uniformly. Common pathways are therefore not fully elucidated. In many severe viral infections there is no treatment other than supportive measures. A better understanding of the pathophysiology behind the association of viral infections and coagulation disorders is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies. This is of special importance in case of severe complications, such as those seen in hemorrhagic viral infections, the incidence of which is increasing worldwide. To date, only a few promising targets have been discovered, meaning the implementation in a clinical context is still hampered. This review discusses non‐hemorrhagic and hemorrhagic viruses for which sufficient data on the association with hemostasis and related clinical features is available. This will enable clinicians to interpret research data and place them into a perspective. J. Med. Virol. 84:1680–1696, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","virology"
"As the most abundant protein on Earth, ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is the key enzyme in carbon fixation of photosynthesis in all green plants. It is hexadecimal polymer, consisting of two kinds of subunits, large and small ones, which are encoded by different genomes. The large subunit (LSU) is encoded by the chloroplast genome; the small one by the nuclear genome. The function of RuBisCO relies on the two subunits, and only when they are combined to be hexadecimal, can it carry out its whole function. However, how the LSU and small subunits evolved, and if they coevolved, has remained mysterious. In this study, based on data in 21 species, phylogenies were analyzed on two subunits, respectively, and a mirror tree was reconstructed to reveal phylogenetic similarity. Furthermore, a comparative analysis method, using the codon usage bias and correlation calculation for RuBisCO subunits, was carried out. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of LSU and small subunits were calculated. Finally, a novel parameter, RSCU distances‐based correlation (RDC), for evaluating molecular coevolution was proposed based on Pearson's correlation coefficient between RSCU value matrices of two subunits. The results show that the topological similarity of the mirror tree gave positive evidence of coevolution between subunits. Similarly, the RDC was high, at 0.558, revealing that the RuBisCO subunits coevolved to an extent. The results confirmed that coevolution happened between the two subunits of RuBisCO, although they were encoded by different genomes. This study added new evidence that functional constraint plays an important role in the evolution of the two subunits.","plant"
"The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is poorly understood and cytokine dysregulation has been suggested as one relevant mechanism to be explored. We compared the cytokine profile in Caco2 cells after infection of SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) with other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (FluAV), and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2). Interferon (IFN) system (production and response) was not suppressed by SARS‐CoV infection. Therefore, SARS‐CoV replication was suppressed by pretreatment with IFN. SARS‐CoV and RSV induced high levels of IL‐6 and RANTES compared with FluAV and hPIV2. Induction level of suppressor of cytokine signaling‐3 (SOCS3) by SARS‐CoV was significantly lower than that by RSV in spite of the significant production of IL‐6. Toll‐like receptors 4 and 9, which correlate with the induction of inflammatory response, were upregulated by SARS‐CoV infection. Collectively, overinduction of inflammatory cytokine and dysregulation of cytokine signaling may contribute to the immunopathology associated with “severe” inflammation in SARS. J. Med.

"A safe and effective adjuvant is necessary to enhance mucosal immune responses for the development of an inactivated intranasal influenza vaccine. The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of surf clam microparticles (SMP) derived from natural surf clams as an adjuvant for an intranasal influenza vaccine. The adjuvant effect of SMP was examined when co‐administered intranasally with inactivated A/PR8 (H1N1) influenza virus hemagglutinin vaccine in BALB/c mice. Administration of the vaccine with SMP induced a high anti‐PR8 haemagglutinin (HA)‐specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) response in the nasal wash and immunoglobulin G (IgG) response in the serum, resulting in protection against both nasal‐restricted infection and lethal lung infection by A/PR8 virus. In addition, administration of SMP with A/Yamagata (H1N1), A/Beijing (H1N1), or A/Guizhou (H3N2) vaccine conferred complete protection against A/PR8 virus challenge in the nasal infection model, suggesting that SMP adjuvanted vaccine can confer cross‐protection against variant influenza viruses.

"BACKGROUND: Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV)‐related virus (XMRV) and other related MLVs have been described with chronic fatigue syndrome and certain types of prostate cancer. In addition, prevalence rates as high as 7% have been reported in blood donors, raising the risk of transfusion‐related transmission. Several laboratories have utilized microneutralization assays as a surrogate marker for detection of anti‐MLV serologic responses—with up to 25% of prostate cancer patients reported to harbor neutralizing antibody responses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a high‐throughput microneutralization assay for research studies on blood donors using retroviral vectors pseudotyped with XMRV‐specific envelopes. Infection with these pseudotypes was neutralized by sera from both macaques and mice challenged with XMRV, but not preimmune serum. A total of 354 plasma samples from blood donors in the Reno/Tahoe area were screened for neutralization. RESULTS: A total of 6.5% of donor samples gave moderate neutralization of XMRV, but not control pseudotypes. However, further testing by Western blot revealed no evidence of antibodies against MLVs in any of these samples. Furthermore, no evidence of infectious virus or viral nucleic acid was observed. CONCLUSION: A microneutralization assay was developed for detection of XMRV and can be applied in a high‐throughput format for large‐scale studies. Although a proportion of blood donors demonstrated the ability to block XMRV envelope‐mediated infection, we found no evidence that this inhibition was mediated by specific antibodies elicited by exposure to XMRV or MLV. It is likely that this moderate neutralization is mediated through another, nonspecific mechanism.","hematology"
"In the winter–spring seasons 2003–2004 and 2004–2005, 47 (5.7%) patients with acute respiratory infection associated with human coronavirus (hCoV) 229E‐, NL63‐, and OC43‐like strains were identified among 823 (597 immunocompetent and 226 immunocompromised) patients admitted to hospital with acute respiratory syndromes. Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT‐PCR) methods. Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified. On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using type‐specific primers targeting genes 1ab and N. The HuH‐7 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43‐ and 229E‐like strains. Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43‐like, 229E‐like, and NL63‐like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively. In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains. NL63‐like strains were not found to circulate in 2003–2004, and 229E‐like strains did not circulate in 2004–2005, while OC43‐like strains were detected in both seasons. The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March. Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group. In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and young children during the first year of life, while all adults were immunocompromised patients. Coinfections of hCoVs and other respiratory viruses (mostly interesting the first year of life) were observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P = 0.002). In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection. In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase. Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection. J. Med. Virol. 78:938–949, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promise as a main actor of cell‐based therapeutic strategies, due to their intrinsic ability to differentiate along different mesenchymal cell lineages, able to repair the diseased or injured tissue in which they are localized. The application of MSCs in therapies requires an in depth knowledge of their biology and of the molecular mechanisms leading to MSC multilineage differentiation. The knockdown of target genes through small interfering RNA (siRNA) carried by adenoviruses (Ad) represents a valid tool for the study of the role of specific molecules in cell biology. Unfortunately, MSCs are poorly transfected by conventional Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors. We set up a method to obtain a very efficient transduction of rat MSCs with low doses of unmodified Ad5, carrying the siRNA targeted against the mRNA coding for Rb2/p130 (Ad‐siRNA‐Rb2), which plays a fundamental role in cell differentiation. This method allowed a 95% transduction rate of Ad‐siRNA in MSC, along with a siRNA‐mediated 85% decrease of Rb2/p130 mRNA and a 70% decrease of Rb2/p130 protein 48 h after transduction with 50 multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of Ad5. The effect on Rb2/p130 protein persisted 15 days after transduction. Finally, Ad‐siRNA did not compromise the viability of transduced MSCs neither induced any cell cycle modification. The effective Ad‐siRNA‐Rb2 we constructed, together with the efficient method of delivery in MSCs we set up, will allow an in depth analysis of the role of Rb2/p130 in MSC biology and multilineage differentiation.

"A recombinant pertussis DNA vaccine was described here with its immunogenicity and the ability to induce protection against B. pertussis infection in mice. Three immunodominant antigen gene fragments of pertussis, pertussis toxin subunit 1 (pts1), fragments of pertactin (prn) and filamentous hemagglutinin (fha), were recombined as fragment pts1‐prn‐fha named ppf, and it was cloned to plasmid pVAX1 as pVAX1/ppf. Compared to those injected with pVAX1, the mice injected with pVAX1/ppf significantly elicited more antigen specific antibody anti‐PTS1, anti‐PRN, anti‐FHA and cytokine IL‐10, IFN‐γ. When pGM‐CSF was coinjected with pVAX1/ppf, the mice showed significantly increases of the three antibodies and cytokine IL‐10, IL‐4, IFN‐γ and TNF‐α compared to those injected with pVAX1 only. The mice in group pVAX1/ppf & pGM‐CSF, in particular; induced much more anti‐PTS1, IL‐4 and TNF‐α than those in group pVAX1/ppf. In the intracerebral mouse protection test, the mice immunized with pVAX1/ppf or pVAX1/ppf & pGM‐CSF induced protection to a lethal dose of B. pertussis. The results indicate that recombinant DNA vaccine and pGM‐CSF coinjection can induce protective immunity against B. pertussis, demonstrating a valuable method to prevent pertussis.","microbiology"

This article offers proposals for fundamental reform—with politically feasible pathways—of the IHR, their operations and implementation, WHO oversight, and State Party conformance. Context: The International Health Regulations (IHR) have been the governing framework for global health security for the past decade and are a nearly universally recognized World Health Organization (WHO) treaty, with 196 States Parties. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic, major global commissions have cast doubt on the future effectiveness of the IHR and the leadership of the WHO. Methods: We conducted a review of the historical origins of the IHR and their performance over the past 10 years and analyzed all of the ongoing reform panel efforts to provide a series of politically feasible recommendations for fundamental reform. Findings: We propose a series of recommendations with realistic pathways for change. These recommendations focus on the development and strengthening of IHR core capacities; independently assessed metrics; new financing mechanisms; harmonization with the Global Health Security Agenda, Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathways, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, and One Health strategies; public health and clinical workforce development; Emergency Committee transparency and governance; tiered public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) processes; enhanced compliance mechanisms; and an enhanced role for civil society. Conclusions: Empowering the WHO and realizing the IHR's potential will shore up global health security—a vital investment in human and animal health—while reducing the vast economic consequences of the next global health emergency.","health"
"Elements and quantification: A nucleic acid assay has been developed, based on an elemental labeling strategy using magnetic microparticles (MMPs), which provides quantification of multiple DNA targets. Rare‐earth elements, indium, and stable isotopes could be labeled with oligonucleotides serving as DNA probes.

"In 2005, human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV‐HKU1) was isolated and identified from a 71‐year‐old man with pneumonia in Hong Kong. To identify and classify genotypes of HCoV‐HKU1 in Korea, a sensitive, specific, and quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed and analyzed the sequences of HCoV‐HKU1 isolated in Korea. A total of 1,985 respiratory specimens taken from patients with acute respiratory illness were tested for HCoV‐HKU1 from January 2007 to May 2008. The major clinical symptoms associated with HCoV‐HKU1 infection were examined statistically and sequence variations of the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid genes were also analyzed. Fifty cases (2.5%) HCoV‐HKU1 were identified by real‐time PCR and viral loads ranged from 6.7 × 104 to 1.6 × 109 copies/ml. The clinical symptoms of HCoV‐HKU1 infection included rhinorrhea (72%), cough (64%), nasal congestion (56%), fever (32%), sputum (30%), sore throat (18%), chills (16%), postnasal discharge (14%), and tonsillar hypertrophy (10%). There was a seasonal distribution of HCoV‐HKU1 infection, peaking in winter and spring. Both genotypes A and B were detected but no recombination between them was found. This is the first report on the identification and genotyping of HCoV‐HKU1 as a causative agent of acute respiratory illness in Korea. The data suggest that at least two genotypes, A and B, of HCoV‐HKU1 with scattered silent mutations were circulating in Korea from 2007 to 2008. J. Med.

"The human colorectal adenocarcinoma‐derived Caco‐2 cell line was evaluated as a means isolating common respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal aspirates for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. One hundred eighty‐nine direct immunofluorescence positive nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from patients with various viral respiratory diseases were cultured in the presence of Caco‐2 cells or the following conventional cell lines: LLC‐MK2, MDCK, HEp‐2, and A549. Caco‐2 cell cultures effectively propagated the majority (84%) of the viruses present in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples compared with any positive cultures obtained using the panel cells (78%) or individual cell line MDCK (38%), HEp‐2 (21%), LLC‐MK2 (27%), or A549 (37%) cell lines. The differences against individual cell line were statistically significant (P = < 0.000001). Culture in Caco‐2 cells resulted in the isolation of 85% (36/42) of viruses which were not cultivated in conventional cell lines. By contrast, 80% (24/30) of viruses not cultivated in Caco‐2 cells were isolated using the conventional panel. The findings indicated that Caco‐2 cells were sensitive to a wide range of viruses and can be used to culture a broad range of respiratory viruses. J. Med.

"Acute gastroenteritis accounts for a significant burden of medically attended illness in children under the age of five. For this study, four multiplex reverse transcription PCR assays were used to determine the incidence of adenovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, norovirus GI and GII, rotavirus, and sapovirus in stool samples submitted for viral electron microscopy (EM) to the Children's Hospital Colorado. Of 1105 stool samples available, viral RNA/DNA was detected in 247 (26.2%) of 941 pediatric samples (median age = 2.97 years, 54% male) with 28 (3.0%) positive for more than one virus. Adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, rotavirus, and sapovirus were detected in 95 (10.0%), 33 (3.5%), 8 (0.9%), 90 (9.6%), 49 (5.2%), and 2 (0.2%) of the pediatric samples, respectively. No coronaviruses were identified. Sequencing of norovirus positive samples indicated an outbreak of norovirus strain GII.4 in 2006 with evidence of numerous circulating strains. Multiple samples from the same immunocompromised patients demonstrated symptomatic shedding of norovirus for up to 32 weeks and astrovirus for 12 weeks. RT‐PCR detected 99 of 111 (89%) adenovirus‐positive samples versus 12 (11%) by EM, and 186 of 192 (97%) sapovirus/astrovirus/norovirus‐positive samples versus 21 (11%) by EM. Noroviruses and adenoviruses are common causes of gastroenteritis in children. Immunocompromised patients can be infected with multiple viruses and shed viruses in their stools for prolonged periods. This data support the superiority of RT‐PCR compared to EM for diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis. J. Med. Virol. 87:931–939, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","virology"
"Assembling a crown from used parts: A virus is a virus because it is a parasite, totally dependent on its host cell for the manufacture and assembly of its components. Some viruses make it easy for the host to get started on required protein synthesis by presenting themselves as a piece of +ve‐strand (translatable) RNA, ribosome‐ready. Other viruses require some prep work before they can start but they bring along the required enzymes in their virion particle. Coronaviruses are +ve‐strand RNA viruses that depend on their host for assembly and secretion. Vogels et al. report on the subversion and suppression of host functions by the SARS coronavirus. Using a powerful set of proteome tools, including stable mass isotope labeling and Golgi‐related fractionation, they identified 578 host proteins, 116 significantly affected by infection. These were categorized by reported function, except for the large group that had no known function. pp. 64–80 Markers for the ups and downs of life?: Bipolar disorder, formerly referred to as Manic‐Depression, is a severe psychiatric disease with a multifactorial etiology and a substantial genetic component. Mood stabilizers include lithium, valproate and carbamazepine, which suppress the manic or depressed symptoms. In the normal or euthymic state, patients may appear normal but still have learning disabilities, attention deficit and other side effects. Herberth et al. applied a number of proteomic techniques in a matched case/control study of euthymic and normal individuals. They focused on pathways associated with the disease by looking at multifactorial profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum using LC‐MS and HumanMap technology. Approximately 60 differentially expressed PBMC proteins were involved with stress response and cell death/survival pathways while serum was associated with inflammation. Treating control PBMCs with euthymic patient serum increased cell death frequency, suggesting that markers are waiting to be found. pp. 94–105 Focusing on the fine points of serum amyloid P: Amyloid P is a component of serum amyloid plaques (SAP). A glycoprotein with 0 to 2 to 8 (say that fast) sialic acids in humans, SAP has been the center of controversy over the degree of microheterogeneity of the human molecule. Basically there are two camps — the mass spec analysis group that maintains SAP is relatively homogeneous, and the high heterogeneity group that bases its “normal” on IEF in polyacrylamide gels, both 1‐D and 2‐D, where 4–8 isoforms are revealed by protein staining. Weiss et al. decided to clear the air of smoke and confusion by using capillary IEF for the analysis, with resolution good down to pI differences of 0.05 when detection is ESI‐MALDI‐MS. The hybrid technique showed SAP to be highly homogeneous among 374 individuals including a number with diseases such as colon cancer, diabetes type 2 and a history of myocardial infarction. pp. 106–113","biochemistry"

HLA‐A, ‐B and ‐DRB1 alleles were determined in 108 healthy unrelated Maonan individuals by the polymerase chain reaction‐Luminex method, and haplotype frequencies for HLA‐A, ‐B and ‐DRB1 loci were estimated. The most frequent HLA‐A alleles were A*1101 (35.2%), A*0203 (17.6%), A*0207 (13.4%) and A*2402 (13.4%); HLA‐B alleles were B*1301(19.9%), B*1502 (14.8%), B*4601 (13.4%) and B*4001 (13.4%); HLA‐DRB1 alleles were DRB1*1202 (17.1%), DRB1*1602 (13.0%) and DRB1*1401 (10.7%). The most common haplotypes were A*0207‐B*4601 (10.6%), A*1101‐B*1301 (10.0%), A*1101‐B*4001 (8.4%), B*1502‐DRB1*1202 (12.0%), B*4601‐DRB1*1401 (5.8%), A*1101‐B*1502‐DRB1*1202 (7.1%) and A*0207‐B*4601‐DRB1*1401 (5.3%), profiles that are also found in populations from the southern region of East Asia.

"Background: A number of strategies have been used to improve the efficacy of the DNA vaccine for the treatment of tumors. These strategies, ranging from activating CD4+ T cell, manipulating antigen presentation and/or processing to anti‐angiogenesis, focus on one certain aspect in the functioning of the vaccine. Therefore, their combination is necessary for rational DNA vaccines design by synergizing different regimens and overcoming the limitations of each strategy. Methods: A DNA fragment (HSV) encoding the C terminal 37 amino acids of human chorionic gonadotropin β chain (hCGβ), 5 different HLA‐restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes from human survivin and the third and fourth extracellular domains of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was inserted into the sequence between the luminal and transmembrane domain of human lysosome‐associated membrane protein‐1 cDNA for the construction of a novel DNA vaccine. Results: This novel vaccine, named p‐L/HSV, has a potent antitumor effect on the LL/2 lung carcinoma model in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The immunologic mechanism involved in the antitumor effect referred to the activation of both cellular and humoral immune response. In addition, the tumor vasculature was abrogated as observed by immunohistochemistry in p‐L/HSV immunized mice. Furthermore, the immunized mice received an additional boost with p‐L/HSV 6 months later and showed a strong immune recall response. Conclusions: The present study indicates that the strategies of combining antitumor with antiangiogenesis and targeting the tumor antigen to the major histocompatibility complex class II pathway cooperate well. Such a study may shed new light on designing vaccine for cancer in the future. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","medicine"
"Microfabricated devices are useful tools for manipulating and interrogating large numbers of single cells in a rapid and cost‐effective manner, but connecting these systems to the existing platforms used in routine high‐throughput screening of libraries of cells remains challenging. Methods to sort individual cells of interest from custom microscale devices to standardized culture dishes in an efficient and automated manner without affecting the viability of the cells are critical. Combining a commercially available instrument for colony picking (CellCelector, AVISO GmbH) and a customized software module, we have established an optimized process for the automated retrieval of individual antibody‐producing cells, secreting desirable antibodies, from dense arrays of subnanoliter containers. The selection of cells for retrieval is guided by data obtained from a high‐throughput, single‐cell screening method called microengraving. Using this system, 100 clones from a mixed population of two cell lines secreting different antibodies (12CA5 and HYB099‐01) were sorted with 100% accuracy (50 clones of each) in ∼2 h, and the cells retained viability. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

"Basic research in the field of molecular biology led to the discovery of the mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans in 1998. RNAi is now widely appreciated as an important gene control mechanism in mammals, and several RNAi‐based gene‐silencing applications have already been used in clinical trials. In this review I will discuss RNAi approaches to inhibit the pathogenic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV‐1), which establishes a chronic infection that would most likely require a durable gene therapy approach. Viruses, such as HIV‐1, are particularly difficult targets for RNAi attack because they mutate frequently, which allows viral escape by mutation of the RNAi target sequence. Combinatorial RNAi strategies are required to prevent viral escape.","multidisciplinary"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious and deadly disease caused by a new coronavirus. The protein sequence of the chymotrypsin‐like cysteine proteinase (CCP) responsible for SARS viral replication has been identified as a target for developing anti‐SARS drugs. Here, I report the ATVRLQp1Ap1'‐bound CCP 3D model predicted by 420 different molecular dynamics simulations (2.0 ns for each simulation with a 1.0‐fs time step). This theoretical model was released at the Protein Data Bank (PDB; code: 1P76) before the release of the first X‐ray structure of CCP (PDB code: 1Q2W). In contrast to the catalytic dyad observed in X‐ray structures of CCP and other coronavirus cysteine proteinases, a catalytic triad comprising Asp187, His41, and Cys145 is found in the theoretical model of the substrate‐bound CCP. The simulations of the CCP complex suggest that substrate binding leads to the displacement of a water molecule entrapped by Asp187 and His41, thus converting the dyad to a more efficient catalytic triad. The CCP complex structure has an expanded active‐site pocket that is useful for anti‐SARS drug design. In addition, this work demonstrates that multiple molecular dynamics simulations are effective in correcting errors that result from low‐sequence‐identity homology modeling.

"Infectious diseases comprise some of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Interactions between pathogen and host proteins underlie the process of infection. Improved understanding of pathogen‐host molecular interactions will increase our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in infection, and allow novel therapeutic solutions to be devised. Complete genome sequences for a number of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as the human host, has led to the revelation of their protein‐protein interaction (PPI) networks. In this post‐genomic era, pathogen‐host interactions (PHIs) operating during infection can also be mapped. Detailed systematic analyses of PPI and PHI data together are required for a complete understanding of pathogenesis of infections. Here we review the striking results recently obtained during the construction and investigation of these networks. Emphasis is placed on studies producing large‐scale interaction data by high‐throughput experimental techniques.","biotechnology"
"A serosurvey of antibodies against selected flaviviruses and alphaviruses in 384 bats (representing 10 genera and 14 species) was conducted in the Caribbean island of Trinidad. Sera were analysed using epitope‐blocking enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) specific for antibodies against West Nile virus (WNV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), all of which are zoonotic viruses of public health significance in the region. Overall, the ELISAs resulted in the detection of VEEV‐specific antibodies in 11 (2.9%) of 384 bats. Antibodies to WNV and EEEV were not detected in any sera. Of the 384 sera, 308 were also screened using hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) for antibodies to the aforementioned viruses as well as St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; which also causes epidemic disease in humans), Rio Bravo virus (RBV), Tamana bat virus (TABV) and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). Using this approach, antibodies to TABV and RBV were detected in 47 (15.3%) and 3 (1.0%) bats, respectively. HIA results also suggest the presence of antibodies to an undetermined flavivirus(es) in 8 (2.6%) bats. Seropositivity for TABV was significantly (P < 0.05; χ2) associated with bat species, location and feeding preference, and for VEEV with roost type and location. Differences in prevalence rates between urban and rural locations were statistically significant (P < 0.05; χ2) for TABV only. None of the aforementioned factors was significantly associated with RBV seropositivity rates.","veterinary"

"Respiratory infections are very common in Kuwait, yet little is known about the cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections. This study was designed to investigate the viral cause of lower respiratory tract infections using sensitive molecular methods. PCR was applied to investigate 10 respiratory viruses in respiratory samples from 1,014 patients aged between 3 days to 76 years with acute lower respiratory tract infections. Of the 1,014 patients with lower respiratory tract infections, 288 (28.4%) had a viral infection. One hundred fifty‐five (53.8%) presented with bronchiolitis, 100 (43.7%) with pneumonia, and 33 (11.5%) with croup. One hundred six (36.8%) and 99 (34.4%) patients had evidence of respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses infections, respectively. Adenoviruses were detected in 44 (15.2%) patients, while influenza A virus in 21 (7.3%) patients. The majority of respiratory syncytial virus infections (84%) were among patients aged <1 year. Similarly, of the 99 patients infected by human rhinoviruses, 50 (50.5%) were also among this age group. In contrast, most of influenza A virus infections, 12 of 21 (57.1%), were among patients aged over 16 years. Parainfluenza virus‐2 and human coronaviruses were not detected in any of the patients' samples. Over the 3‐year period, most of the hospitalized patients were seen during the autumn and winter months from October through March. These data show that respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinoviruses may be the major causes of lower respiratory tract infections in children admitted to hospital in Kuwait. J. Med.

"This study was conducted to investigate efficiency of TiO2nanomaterial as a novel environment‐friendly disinfectant to control avian influenza (AI) by its photochemical sterilization ability. Anatase nano‐TiO2sol, a neutral, viscous aqueous colloid of 1.6% TiO2, was synthesized from peroxotitanic acid solution according to the Ichinose method. Transmission electron microscope images showed that the TiO2particles were spindle‐shaped with an average size of 50 nm. X‐ray diffraction patterns revealed that the crystal phase of TiO2particles was anatase type with photocatalytic effect. A photocatalytic film of nano‐TiO2sol was tested as a means of inactivating H9N2avian influenza virus (AIV). Inactivation capabilities were examined with 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) radiation under black light by adjusting the UV intensity, the UV irradiation time and the quantity of AIV. The titer change of AIV was determined by hemagglutination tests. Cytopathic effect of Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was monitored by inverted fluorescence microscope. The results showed that anatase nano‐TiO2sol significantly inactivated AIV under UV irradiation of 365 nm. The inactivation of AIV viruses reached up to 100%. Therefore, anatase nano‐TiO2sol is a potentially environment‐friendly antivirus agent to prevent AI.","biophysics"
"Cardiovascular diseases have been one of the leading killers among the human population worldwide. During the heart development, cardiomyocytes undergo a transition from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth with an unclear underlying mechanism. In this study, we aim to investigate how interferons differentially stimulate the interferon‐inducible transmembrane (IFITM) family proteins and further be involved in the process of heart development. The expression levels of three IFITM family members, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were investigated during Sprague–Dawley rat myocardial development and differentiation of H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The effects of interferon‐α, ‐β, and ‐γ on DNA synthesis in H9C2 cells were also characterized. Up‐regulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were observed during the heart development of Sprague–Dawley rat and the differentiation of H9C2 cells. Moreover, interferon‐α and ‐β induce the expression of IFITM3 while interferon‐γ up‐regulates IFITM1. Finally, interferon‐α and ‐β were demonstrated to inhibit DNA synthesis during H9C2 cell differentiation.

"Between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells there is dramatic difference in complexity which represents a problem for the current version of the cell theory, as well as for the current version of evolution theory. In the past few decades, the serial endosymbiotic theory of Lynn Margulis has been confirmed. This results in a radical departure from our understanding of living systems: the eukaryotic cell represents de facto“cells‐within‐cell.” Higher order “cells‐within‐cell” situations are obvious at the eukaryotic cell level in the form of secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis, or in the male and female gametophytes of higher plants. The next challenge of the current version of the cell theory is represented by the fact that the multicellular fungi and plants are, in fact, supracellular assemblies as their cells are not physically separated from each other. Moreover, there are also examples of alliances and mergings between multicellular organisms. Infection, especially the viral one, but also bacterial and fungal infections, followed by symbiosis, is proposed to act as the major force that drives the biological evolution toward higher complexity.","multidisciplinary"
"Human infections come from two main sources. Our ‘family heirlooms’ have co‐evolved with the host as we diverged from the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, and these are often vertically transmitted. Our ‘new acquisitions’ come from cross‐species infections, and these are typically horizontally transmitted. Compared with other apes, naked apes harbor a larger variety of pathogens, acquired from the domesticated and commensal non‐primate species which share our habitat, as well as from exotic species. Thus we are nouveaux riches in our collection of infections or ‘metagenome’ and this is reviewed with particular reference to retroviruses. Nakedness poses a challenge to ectoparasites which is discussed in relation to the origin and evolution of human lice from those of the great apes. As humans have acquired infections horizontally from our closest living relatives, the chimpanzee and the gorilla, might we also have exchanged pathogens with other hominid species?","zoology"
"Abstract Background  The predominant mode of HIV‐1 transmission is by heterosexual contact. The cervical/vaginal mucosa is the main port of HIV entry in women. A safe and effective topical microbicide against HIV is urgently needed to prevent sexual transmission. Hence, we evaluated griffithsin (GRFT), a 12.7 kDa carbohydrate‐binding protein, both native and recombinant GRFT, potently inhibited both CXCR4‐and CCR5‐tropic HIV infection and transmission in vitro. Methods  The antiviral efficacy of native and recombinant GRFT against CXCR4‐and CCR5‐tropic HIV and SHIV strains and SIVmac251 was evaluated by in vitro assays. We also evaluated the time course of antiviral activity and stability of GRFT in cervical/vaginal lavage as a function of pH 4–8. Results  Griffithsin blocked CXCR4‐and CCR5‐tropic viruses at less than 1 nm concentrations and exhibited a high potency. GRFT was stable in cervical/vaginal lavage fluid and maintained a similar potency of anti‐HIV activity. GRFT is not only a highly potent HIV entry inhibitor, but also prevents cell fusion and cell‐to‐cell transmission of HIV. Conclusions  The in vitro efficacy of GRFT revealed low cytotoxicity, high potency, rapid onset of antiviral activity and long‐term stability in cervical/vaginal lavage. GRFT is an excellent candidate for anti‐HIV microbicide development.","zoology"
"In this study, we applied a quantitative proteomic approach, based on SILAC, to investigate the interactions of coronaviruses with the secretory pathway of the host cell, with the aim to identify host factors involved in coronavirus replication. Comparison of the protein profiles of Golgi‐enriched fractions of cells that were either mock infected or infected with mouse hepatitis virus revealed the significant depletion or enrichment of 116 proteins. Although ribosomal/nucleic acid binding proteins were enriched in the Golgi‐fractions of mouse hepatitis virus‐infected cells, proteins annotated to localize to several organelles of the secretory pathway were overrepresented among the proteins that were depleted from these fractions upon infection. We hypothesized that proteins, of which the abundance or distribution is affected by infection, are likely to be involved in the virus life cycle. Indeed, depletion of a small subset of the affected proteins by using small interfering RNAs identified several host factors involved in coronavirus infection. Transfection of small interfering RNAs targeting either C11orf59 or Golgi apparatus glycoprotein 1 resulted in increased virus replication, whereas depletion of vesicle‐trafficking protein vesicle‐trafficking protein sec22b enhanced the release of infectious progeny virus. Overexpression of these proteins, on the other hand, had a negative effect on virus replication. Overall, our study shows that the SILAC approach is a suitable tool to study host–pathogen interactions and to identify host proteins involved in virus replication.","biochemistry"

These included previously described protein‐ and lipid‐based antigenic targets and newly discovered autoimmunogenic sugar moieties, notably, autoantibodies specific for the oligomannoses in both MS patient CSF and the sera of mice with EAE. These glycans are often masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of cryptic autoantigens. We further determined that these targets are highly expressed on multiple cell types in MS and EAE lesions. Co‐immunization of SJL/J mice with a Man9‐KLH conjugate at the time of EAE induction elicited highly significant levels of anti‐Man9‐cluster autoantibodies. Nevertheless, this anti‐glycan autoantibody response was associated with a significantly reduced clinical severity of EAE. The potential of these cryptic glycan markers and targeting antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of neurological disorders has yet to be explored.","pharmacology"
"Objectives  Alteronol is a novel compound purified from fermentation products of a microorganism in the bark of the yew tree. The study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of alteronol. Methods  Human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa was cultured in vitro. The cell viability was evaluated by using sulforhodamine B assay. The cell cycle distribution was analysed by flow cytometry. The level of cyclin D1 protein was evaluated using Western blot analysis. The changes in cyclinD1, CDK4 and p21 were detected by ELISA assay and the changes in G1‐related regulators were detected by RT‐PCR assay. Key findings  Our data showed that alteronol inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells and induced G1 phase arrest. Downregulation of the mRNA levels of CDK2, CDK4 and cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21 in alteronol‐treated cells were observed. Conclusions  Downregulation of the mRNA levels of CDK2, CDK4 and cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21 might be a possible mechanism for the inhibition of proliferation induced by alteronol in HeLa cells.","pharmacology"
"Objective:  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emergent disease due to a novel coronavirus, which caused outbreaks worldwide. Methodology:  We report a SARS patient who had developed recurrent chest pain and acute T‐wave inversion over the precordial leads on electrocardiography (ECG). Results:  She developed progressive subcutaneous emphysema a few days later. Her CXR showed features suggestive of pneumomediastinum, which was confirmed by high‐resolution CT scan of the thorax. Conclusion:  Pneumomediastinum should be considered in SARS patients as a possible cause of chest pain and ECG changes that mimic acute coronary syndrome.","respiratory"
"Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on host cells detect pathogens to activate innate immunity which, in turn, initiates inflammatory and adaptive immune responses. Successful activation of PRRs is, therefore, critical to controlling infections and driving pathogen‐specific adaptive immunity, but overactivity of PRRs causes systemic inflammation, which is detrimental to the host. Here we review the PRR literature as it relates to horses and speculate on the role PRRs may play in sepsis and endotoxaemia.","veterinary"
"Bats are hosts of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) known to potentially cross the host–species barrier. For analysing coronavirus diversity in a bat species‐rich country, a total of 421 anal swabs/faecal samples from Costa Rican bats were screened for CoV RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences by a pancoronavirus PCR. Six families, 24 genera and 41 species of bats were analysed. The detection rate for CoV was 1%. Individuals (n = 4) from four different species of frugivorous (Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia perspicillata and Carollia castanea) and nectivorous (Glossophaga soricina) bats were positive for coronavirus‐derived nucleic acids. Analysis of 440 nt. RdRp sequences allocated all Costa Rican bat CoVs to the α‐CoV group. Several CoVs sequences clustered near previously described CoVs from the same species of bat, but were phylogenetically distant from the human CoV sequences identified to date, suggesting no recent spillover events. The Glossophaga soricina CoV sequence is sufficiently dissimilar (26% homology to the closest known bat CoVs) to represent a unique coronavirus not clustering near other CoVs found in the same bat species so far, implying an even higher CoV diversity than previously suspected.","veterinary"
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) cases without documented contact with another human MERS‐CoV case make up 61% (517/853) of all reported cases. These primary cases are of particular interest for understanding the source(s) and route(s) of transmission and for designing long‐term disease control measures. Dromedary camels are the only animal species for which there is convincing evidence that it is a host species for MERS‐CoV and hence a potential source of human infections. However, only a small proportion of the primary cases have reported contact with camels. Other possible sources and vehicles of infection include food‐borne transmission through consumption of unpasteurized camel milk and raw meat, medicinal use of camel urine and zoonotic transmission from other species. There are critical knowledge gaps around this new disease which can only be closed through traditional field epidemiological investigations and studies designed to test hypothesis regarding sources of infection and risk factors for disease. Since the 1960s, there has been a radical change in dromedary camel farming practices in the Arabian Peninsula with an intensification of the production and a concentration of the production around cities. It is possible that the recent intensification of camel herding in the Arabian Peninsula has increased the virus' reproductive number and attack rate in camel herds while the ‘urbanization’ of camel herding increased the frequency of zoonotic ‘spillover’ infections from camels to humans. It is reasonable to assume, although difficult to measure, that the sensitivity of public health surveillance to detect previously unknown diseases is lower in East Africa than in Saudi Arabia and that sporadic human cases may have gone undetected there.","veterinary"
"The therapeutic effects of melatonin against viral infections, with emphasis on the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), are reviewed. Melatonin has been shown to prevent paralysis and death in mice infected with the encephalomyocarditis virus and to decrease viremia. Melatonin also postpones the onset of the disease produced by Semliki Forest virus inoculation and reduces the mortality of West Nile virus‐infected mice stressed by either isolation or dexamethasone injection. An increase in the host resistance to the virus via a peripheral immunostimulatory activity is considered responsible for these effects. It has also been demonstrated that melatonin protects some strains of mink against Aleutian disease, and prevents the reduction of B‐ and T‐cells as well as Th1 cytokine secretion in mice infected with leukemia retrovirus. In VEE‐infected mice, melatonin postpones the onset of the disease and death for several days and reduces the mortality rate. This protective effect seems to be due to the increase in the production of interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), as 100% of the infected mice treated with melatonin die when IL‐1β is blocked with antimurine IL‐1β antibodies. Although melatonin administration raises serum levels of tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) and interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ), the mortality observed in neutralization experiments with the corresponding anticytokine antibodies, suggests that neither TNF‐α nor IFN‐γ are essential for the protective effect of melatonin on murine VEE virus infection. Melatonin treatment also enhances the efficiency of immunization against the VEE virus. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the dissemination of this virus, and their deleterious effects may be diminished by melatonin. This indole inhibits nitric oxide synthetase activity and it is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide, which also plays an important role in the spread of the VEE virus. In conclusion, the immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects of melatonin suggest that this indole must be considered as an additional therapeutic alternative to fight viral diseases.","physiology"
"Small RNAs, including short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are ubiquitous, versatile repressors of gene expression in plants, animals, and many fungi. They can trigger destruction of homologous mRNA or inhibition of cognate mRNA translation and play an important role in maintaining the stable state of chromosome structure and regulating the expression of protein‐coding genes. Furthermore, the recent research showed that there exists close relationship between small RNAs and human diseases. Several human diseases have surfaced in which miRNAs or their machinery might be implicated, such as some neurological diseases and cancers. The specificity and potency of small RNAs suggest that they might be promising as therapeutic agents. This article will review the role of small RNAs in some human diseases etiology and investigations of taking siRNAs as therapeutic tools for treating viral infection, cancer, and other diseases. We also discuss the potential of miRNAs in gene therapy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","pharmacology"
"Background and objective:  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in 2003 and its long‐term sequelae remain largely unclear. This study examined the long‐term outcome of pulmonary function, exercise capacity, health and work status among SARS survivors. Methods:  A prospective cohort study of SARS patients at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong was conducted, with serial assessments of lung function, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after disease onset. The work status was also recorded. Results:  Serial assessments were completed by 55 of the 123 (39.9%) subjects, of whom 27 were health‐care workers (HCW). The mean age of the group was 44.4 (SD 13.2) years and 19 (34.5%) were males. At 24 months, 10 (18.2%), 9 (16.4%), 6 (10.9%) and 29 (52.7%) subjects had FEV1, FVC, TLC and DLCO < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The mean (SD) 6MWD increased significantly from 439.0 (89.1) m at 3 months to 460.1 (102.8) m at 6 months (P 0.016) and became steady after 6 months. However, 6MWD and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey scores were lower than the normal population throughout the study. Moreover, 29.6% of HCW and 7.1% of non‐HCW had not returned to work 2 years after illness onset. Conclusions:  This 2‐year study of a selected population of SARS survivors, showed significant impairment of DLCO, exercise capacity and health status persisted, with a more marked adverse impact among HCW.","respiratory"
"The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of vascular resistance, sodium and water homeostasis and the response to tissue injury. Historically, angiotensin II (Ang II) was thought to be the primary effector peptide of this system. Ang II is produced predominantly by the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang II acts mainly through the angiotensin II type‐1 receptor (AT1) and, together with ACE, these components represent the ‘classical’ axis of the RAS. Drug therapies targeting the RAS by inhibiting Ang II formation (ACE inhibitors) or binding to its receptor (angiotensin receptor blockers) are now in widespread clinical use and have been shown to reduce tissue injury and fibrosis in cardiac and renal disease independently of their effects on blood pressure. In 2000, two groups using different methodologies identified a homolog of ACE, called ACE2, which cleaves Ang II to form the biologically active heptapeptide, Ang‐(1–7). Conceptually, ACE2, Ang‐(1–7), and its putative receptor, the mas receptor represent an ‘alternative’ axis of the RAS capable of opposing the often deleterious actions of Ang II. Interestingly, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers increase Ang‐(1–7) production and it has been proposed that some of the beneficial effects of these drugs are mediated through upregulation of Ang‐(1–7) rather than inhibition of Ang II production or receptor binding. The present review focuses on the novel components and pathways of the RAS with particular reference to their potential contribution towards the pathophysiology of liver disease.","gastroenterology"
"Background: The worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS‐CoV. We report the use of DNAzyme (catalytic DNA) to target the 5′‐untranslated region (5′UTR) of a highly conserved fragment in the SARS genome as an approach to suppression of SARS‐CoV replication. A mono‐DNA enzyme (Dz‐104) possessing the 10–23 catalytic motif was synthesized and tested both in vitro and in cell culture. Materials and methods: SARS‐CoV total RNA was isolated, extracted from the SARS‐CoV‐WHU strain and converted into cDNA. We designed a RNA‐cleaving 10–23 DNAzyme targeting at the loop region of the 5′UTR of SARS‐CoV. The designed DNAzyme, Dz‐104, and its mutant version, Dz‐104 (mut), as a control consist of 9 + 9 arm sequences with a 10–23 catalytic core. In vitro cleavage was performed using an in vitro transcribed 5′UTR RNA substrate. A vector containing a fused 5′UTR and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) was co‐transfected with the DNAzyme into E6 cells and the cells expressing eGFP were visualized with fluorescence microscopy and analyzed by fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS). Results and conclusions: Our results demonstrated that this DNAzyme could efficiently cleave the SARS‐CoV RNA substrate in vitro and inhibit the expression of the SARS‐CoV 5′UTR‐eGFP fusion RNA in mammalian cells. This work presents a model system to rapidly screen effective DNAzymes targeting SARS and provides a basis for potential therapeutic use of DNA enzymes to combat the SARS infection.

"Background.  RNA interference, a conserved mechanism in which a sequence‐specific gene‐silencing process is mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), is a promising method of gene therapy in treating a variety of viral diseases. Aim.  To investigate the antiviral effects of siRNA on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV‐1) replication in Vero cells. Methods.  The antiviral effects of siRNA duplexes targeting the VP16 and DNA polymerase genes of HSV‐1 were evaluated by yield‐reduction and plaque‐reduction assays. The effect of siRNA on the expression of target genes was measured by real‐time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results.  Two siRNA duplexes (siRNA‐1, targeting VP16, and siRNA‐4, targeting DNA polymerase), were found to be highly effective in inhibiting HSV‐1 replication. siRNA‐1 and siRNA‐4 reduced HSV‐1 replication by around 2 log10 and 1 log10 in the yield‐‐reduction assay and by ∼85% and ∼70% in the plaque‐reduction assay, respectively. Significant decreases in the mRNA level of VP16 and DNA polymerase genes were detected after viral infection in the Vero cells pretreated with siRNA‐1 and siRNA‐4, respectively. Conclusion.  These results indicate that siRNA can potently inhibit HSV‐1 replication in vitro, suggesting that siRNA‐based antiviral therapy may be a potential effective therapeutic alternative for patients with HSV‐1 infection.","dermatology"
"RNA interference (RNAi), a conserved mechanism triggered by small interfering RNA (siRNA), has been used for suppressing gene expression through RNA degradation. The replication of caliciviruses (CVs) with RNAi was studied using the Tulane virus (TV) as a model. Five siRNAs targeting the non‐structural, the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) structural genes of the TV were developed and the viruses were quantified using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay. Treatment of the cells with siRNA 4 hr before viral inoculation significantly reduced viral titer by up to 2.6 logs and dramatically decreased viral RNA copy numbers and viral titers 48 hr post infection in four of the five siRNAs studied. The results were confirmed by Western blot, in which the major structural protein VP1 was markedly reduced in both the cells and the culture medium. Two small protein bands of the shell (S) and protruding (P) domains of the viral capsid protein were also detected in the cell lysates, although their role in viral replication remains unknown. Since the TV shares many biological properties with human noroviruses (NoVs), the successful demonstration of RNAi in TV replication would provide valuable information in control of acute gastroenteritis caused by human NoVs.

"To prevent protein aggregation, some proteins are usually expressed as fusion proteins from which target proteins can be released by proteolytic or chemical reagents. In this report, small ubiquitin‐related modifier (SUMO) linked with a hexa‐histidine tag was used as a fusion partner for the antitumor‐analgesic peptide from the venom of Buthus martensii (Karsch) scorpion (AGAP). The optimal expression level of the soluble fusion protein, SUMO‐AGAP, was up to 40% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni‐NTA affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO‐specific protease (Ulp1) to obtain the recombinant AGAP (rAGAP), which was further purified by Ni‐NTA affinity chromatography. The purified final product was >95% pure by SDS‐PAGE stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R‐250. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the protein to be 7142.63 Dalton, which equaled the theoretically expected mass. N‐terminal sequencing of rAGAP showed the sequence corresponded to the native protein. MTT assay indicated the rAGAP could significantly inhibit the proliferation of Jurkat and Hut 78 T lymphoma cell lines. The further writhing experiment showed that the rAGAP had an intensive analgesic effect. The expression strategy presented in this study allows convenient high yield and easy purification of the rAGAP with native sequences. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

"The spread of parasites is inherently a spatial process often embedded in physically complex landscapes. It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional ‘landscapes’ such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.","evolutionary"
"The Taiwanese government has provided free highly active antiretroviral therapy since April 1997. Previously, we have reported on the molecular epidemiology of HIV‐1 in Taiwan from 1988 to 1998. In addition, an outbreak of circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC among intravenous drug users was noted in 2004. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to elucidate the distribution of HIV‐1 subtypes among different high‐risk groups in Taiwan from 1999 to 2000 and to conduct surveillance on drug resistance among treatment naïve patients from 1997 to 2000. Blood samples from 239 HIV‐1/AIDS patients and their subtypes were examined using DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that among 226 male patients, 213 (94.2%) had subtype B, 11 (4.9%) had CRF01_AE, 1 had unique recombinant strain related to both CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC (strain T12‐99TW) and 1 had CRF08_BC (strain L9312‐00TW). The patients infected with T12‐99TW and L9312‐00TW were intravenous drug users and had needle‐sharing experiences in Yunnan Province, China. Of the 13 HIV‐1‐infected females, 7 (53.8%) had subtype B, 5 (38.5%) had CRF01_AE, and 1 (7.7%) had subtype C. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the neither strain T12‐99TW nor L9312‐00TW clustered with CRF07_BC strains isolated from Taiwanese intravenous drug users in 2004. In addition, 126 treatment naïve patients were selected for genotypic DR analysis and the results showed that 4.3% (2/47) homosexual males had M184V mutations. This is the first report on the identification of CRF08_BC and a unique recombinant strain related to both CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC in Taiwan. J. Med.

"Does an infectious disease have one, singular pathogenic cause, or many interacting causes? In the discipline of medical microbiology, there is no definitive theoretical answer to this question: there, the conditions of aetiological possibility exist in a curious tension. Ever since the late 19th century, the “germ theory of disease”–“one disease, one cause”– has co‐existed with a much less well known theory of “multifactorality”–“one disease, many interacting causes”. And yet, in practice, it is always a singular and never a multifactorial aetiology that emerges once the pathogenic world is brought into the field of medical perception. This paper seeks to understand why. Performing a detailed, genealogical reading of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, it foregrounds a set of links that connect the practical diagnostic tools at work within contemporary, 21st century laboratories to the philosophical assumptions at work within late‐19th century understandings of the “germ theory of disease”.","sociology"
"In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of Western blot analysis to monitor changes in the abundance of the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein. In the Western blot procedure, heat denaturation is a common, early step. We now report that heating samples to 90°C decreases the abundance of the SERT protein band and causes dispersion of a majority of the SERT signal to a high molecular weight smear. These observations are in keeping with the fact that heating can influence the electrophoretic behavior of some proteins. By omitting the heat denaturation step in the Western blot procedure, better detection of the SERT protein is achieved. Synapse 61:875–876, 2007. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","neurosciences"
"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) main protease (Mpro) cleaves two virion polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab); this essential process represents an attractive target for the development of anti‐SARS drugs. The functional unit of Mpro is a homodimer and each subunit contains a His41/Cys145 catalytic dyad. Large amounts of biochemical and structural information are available on Mpro; nevertheless, the mechanism by which monomeric Mpro is converted into a dimer during maturation still remains poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that a C‐terminal residue, Arg298, interacts with Ser123 of the other monomer in the dimer, and mutation of Arg298 results in a monomeric structure with a collapsed substrate‐binding pocket. Interestingly, the R298A mutant of Mpro shows a reversible substrate‐induced dimerization that is essential for catalysis. Here, the conformational change that occurs during substrate‐induced dimerization is delineated by X‐ray crystallography. A dimer with a mutual orientation of the monomers that differs from that of the wild‐type protease is present in the asymmetric unit. The presence of a complete substrate‐binding pocket and oxyanion hole in both protomers suggests that they are both catalytically active, while the two domain IIIs show minor reorganization. This structural information offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanism associated with substrate‐induced dimerization and has important implications with respect to the maturation of the enzyme.","crystallography"

"This study examines the connections between familiar (influenza) and unfamiliar (SARS) risks among the general public in a SARS affected society. Using a survey of 350 respondents in Chonju, we find that risk perceptions and a belief that influenza vaccination reduces the incidence of SARS explain behavioral intentions for influenza vaccination and purchase responses to a hypothetical SARS vaccine. Those respondents who believe that an influenza vaccination will very likely reduce SARS incidence have a high probability (79%) of intending to vaccinate, but a much lower WTP for a SARS vaccine than those without such a belief. This belief undoubtedly was influenced by a reframing of influenza vaccination as preventing SARS. Such reframing may lead to short‐term improvements in vaccination rates to the detriment of long‐term SARS vaccination development. When compared with a similar study in Taiwan, societal risk perceptions of SARS and WTP for a vaccine vary greatly according to the extent of a society's experience with SARS.","social"
"Bats have been demonstrated to be natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV. Faecal samples from 248 individuals of 20 bat species were tested for partial RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase gene of CoV and 57 faecal samples from eight bat species were tested positive. The highest detection rate of 44% for Scotophilus kuhlii, followed by 30% for Rhinolophus monoceros. Significantly higher detection rates of coronaviral RNA were found in female bats and Scotophilus kuhlii roosting in palm trees. Phylogenetic analysis classified the positive samples into SARS‐related (SARSr) CoV, Scotophilus bat CoV 512 close to those from China and Philippines, and Miniopterus bat CoV 1A‐related lineages. Coronaviral RNA was also detected in bat guano from Scotophilus kuhlii and Myotis formosus flavus on the ground and had potential risk for human exposure. Diverse bat CoV with zoonotic potential could be introduced by migratory bats and maintained in the endemic bat population in Taiwan.","veterinary"
"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Taiwan in 2003. SARS complicated with rhabdomyolysis has rarely been reported. This study reported three cases of rhabdomyolysis developing during the clinical course of SARS. Thirty probable SARS patients were admitted to the isolation wards at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 4 April and 4 June 2003. Thirty patients, including four men and 26 women aged from 12 to 87 years (mean age 40). Eleven (36.7%) patients had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation with paralytic therapy; three (10%) patients had rhabdomyolysis complicated with acute renal failure and one received haemodialysis; four (13.3%) patients died. Three cases with rhabdomyolysis all received sedative and paralytic therapy for mechanical ventilation. Haemodialysis was performed on one patient. Two patients died from multiple organ failure, and one patient fully recovered from rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure. SARS is a serious respiratory illness, and its aetiology is a novel coronavirus. Rhabdomyolysis resulting from SARS virus infection was strongly suspected. Immobilisation under paralytic therapy and steroids may also be important in developing rhabdomyolysis.","medicine"
"Systems biology depends on a comprehensive assignment and characterization of the interactions of proteins and polypeptides (functional proteomics) and of other classes of biomolecules in a given organism. High‐capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening, but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries, affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry, and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies, the applications of ACE span from low‐affinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity, e.g., in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies, e.g., for fast processing immunoassay. Also, approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte–ligand interaction for drug, immunoassay, and aptamer development are increasingly important, but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research. In addition, the present overview emphasizes that distinct challenges regarding sensitivity, parallel processing, information‐rich detection, interfacing with MS, analyte recovery, and preparative capabilities remain. This will be addressed by future technological improvements that will ensure continuing new applications of ACE in the years to come.","chemistry"

"As a new and burgeoning area following genomics and proteomics, glycomics has become a hot issue due to its pivotal roles in many physiological and pathological processes. Glycans are much more complicated than genes or proteins since glycans are highly branched and dynamic. Antibodies and lectins are the two major molecular tools applied for glycan profiling. Though the study of antibodies and lectins started at almost the same time in 1880s, lectins gained much less attention than the antibodies until recent decades when the importance and difficulties of glycomics were realized. The present review summarizes the discovery history of lectins and their biological functions with a special emphasis on their various applications as biological tools. Both older techniques that had been developed in the last century and new technologies developed in recent years, especially lectin microarrays and lectin‐based biosensors, are included in this account.","pharmacology"

"1 The stripe‐backed weasel Mustela strigidorsa is one of the rarest and least‐known mustelids in the world. Its phylogenetic relationships with other Mustela species remain controversial, though several unique morphological features distinguish it from congeners. 2 It probably lives mainly in evergreen forests in hills and mountains, but has also been recorded from plains forest, dense scrub, secondary forest, grassland and farmland. Known sites range in altitude from 90 m to 2500 m. Data are insufficient to distinguish between habitat and altitudes which support populations, and those where only dispersing animals may occur. 3 It has been confirmed from many localities in north‐east India, north and central Myanmar, south China, north Thailand, north and central Laos, and north and central Vietnam. Given the limited survey effort, the number of recent records shows that the species is not as rare as hitherto believed. Neither specific nor urgent conservation needs are apparent.","zoology"
"Objective:  There is so far no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for the coronavirus‐associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We aimed to analyse the outcomes of a standard treatment strategy comprising antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin, a 3‐week step‐down course of corticosteroids, and the possibility of pulsed methylprednisolone rescue in the event of deterioration. Methodology:  This was a prospective cohort study performed at a major public‐funded hospital in Hong Kong. Eighty‐eight World Health Organisation/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention probable cases of SARS (97% laboratory‐confirmed) were treated with a standard protocol previously reported. Seventy‐one patients treated de novo were analysed in detail with regard to time to clinical stabilization after combination treatment, requirement of additional therapy (pulsed methylprednisolone; assisted ventilation); and final outcomes (recovery, mortality). Results:  The mean age was 42. Twenty‐one patients (24%) had comorbidities. Three of 71 treated de novo recovered with antibiotics alone. The remaining 68 received combination treatment at a mean of 5.8 days after symptom onset, of whom 30 subsequently required pulsed methylprednisolone rescue (independent predictors: older age and higher LDH) and 18 required assisted ventilation (independent predictors: older age, higher oxygen requirement and creatinine level). Their median time to clinical stabilization was 8.0 days after combination treatment (independent predictor for longer time to stabilization: median age of 41 or above). Common complications were hyperglycaemia (58%), pneumo‐mediastinum/thoraces (13%), psychiatric manifestations (7%) and ventilator‐associated pneumonia (2%). One patient (1%) died of SARS‐related respiratory failure. All‐cause mortality was 3.4%, occurring in patients aged > 65 years only. None of the discharged survivors required continuation of oxygen therapy. Conclusions:  This standard treatment protocol resulted in overall satisfactory outcomes. Randomized controlled trial is suggested to confirm its efficacy.","respiratory"
"Little is known about the epidemiological characteristics of HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co‐infection in cities in China with low HIV prevalence. This study evaluated the level of exposure to different risk factors associated with HCV transmission and characterized the distribution of HCV genotypes in 356 HIV‐1‐positive patients in Wuhan, central China. HIV transmission routes were distributed as follows: heterosexual contact, male‐to‐male sexual contact, intravenous drug use, blood transfusion, and unknown route. HCV antibodies were detected by a third‐generation enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. HCV‐positive plasmas were subjected to RNA extraction, RT‐PCR amplification, and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis characterized HCV subtypes and the evolutionary origin of circulating HCV strains. Ninety‐two of 356 (25.8%) patients infected with HIV were anti‐HCV‐positive. Among co‐infected patients, the predominant risk for HCV transmission was intravenous drug use (87.3%). Six HCV subtypes (1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 3b, and 6a) were detected. HCV genotype 6a was most prevalent, occurring in 39.3% of all patients, followed by genotypes 1b (24.7%), 3b (18.0%), and 3a (9.8%). The least frequent genotypes were 1a (4.9%) and 2a (3.3%). Intravenous drug use was strongly associated with genotype 6a, and infection by blood or blood product transfusion was strongly associated with genotype 1b. Genotype 2a was detected only among those infected by male‐to‐male sexual contact. The distribution of HCV subtypes suggests that the city plays a crucial role as a hub of HCV transmission in China. Exposure to multiple risk factors associated with HCV transmission was common among patients co‐infected with HIV and HCV. J Med. Virol. 85:1712–1723, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","virology"
"The lipid raft hypothesis proposed that these microdomains are small (10–200 nM), highly dynamic and enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and signalling phospholipids, which compartmentalize cellular processes. These membrane regions play crucial roles in signal transduction, phagocytosis and secretion, as well as pathogen adhesion/interaction. Throughout evolution, many pathogens have developed mechanisms to escape from the host immune system, some of which are based on the host membrane microdomain machinery. Thus lipid rafts might be exploited by pathogens as signalling and entry platforms. In this review, we summarize the role of lipid rafts as players in the overall invasion process used by different pathogens to escape from the host immune system.","cell"
"Rotavirus (RV) infection is the main cause of acute dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children below 5 years old worldwide. RV infection causes a global shutoff of host proteins as many other viruses do. However, previous studies revealed that RV could selectively upregulated the expression of some host proteins that then played important roles in RV infection. To globally explor such host proteins that were upregulated in early human rotavirus (HRV) infection, proteomic methods were used and a total of ten upregulated host proteins were unambiguously identified. Cyclophilin A (CYPA), a peptidyl‐prolyl cis‐trans isomerase, was among these upregulated host proteins. Following infection, CYPA was recruited to the viroplasm and interacted with HRV structural protein VP2; CYPA reduced host susceptibility to HRV infection and inhibited replication of HRV by repressing the expression of viral proteins. Furthermore, we found that the increased expression of CYPA in enterocytes of small intestine correlated to the period when BALB/c mice became resistant to RV diarrhea. Together, we identified CYPA as a novel host restriction factor that confered protection against RV infection and might contribute to host susceptibility to RV diarrhea.","biochemistry"
"Acute respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of hospital admission of children. This study used a broad capture, rapid and sensitive method (multiplex PCR assay) to detect 20 different respiratory pathogens including influenza A subtypes H1, H3, and H5; influenza B; parainfluenza types 1, 2, 3, and 4; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) groups A and B; adenoviruses; human rhinoviruses; enteroviruses; human metapneumoviruses; human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and SARS‐CoV; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Legionella pneumophila; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae; from respiratory specimens of 475 children hospitalized over a 12‐month period for acute respiratory tract infections. The overall positive rate (47%) was about twice higher than previous reports based on conventional methods. Influenza A, parainfluenza and RSV accounted for 51%, and non‐cultivable viruses accounted for 30% of positive cases. Influenza A peaked at March and June. Influenza B was detected in January, February, and April. Parainfluenza was prevalent throughout the year except from April to June. Most RSV infections were found between February and September. Adenovirus had multiple peaks, whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43 were detected mainly in winter and early spring. RSV infection was associated with bronchiolitis, and parainfluenza was associated with croup; otherwise the clinical manifestations were largely nonspecific. In general, children infected with influenza A, adenovirus and mixed viruses had higher temperatures. In view of the increasing concern about unexpected outbreaks of severe viral infections, a rapid multiplex PCR assay is a valuable tool to enhance the management of hospitalized patients, and for the surveillance for viral infections circulating in the community.

"Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus, belonging to the genus Bocavirus. The virus was identified recently in Sweden, and has now been detected in several different countries. Although it is associated with lower respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients, the incidence of HBoV infection in a developed country in South East Asia, has not been examined. The objective of this study was to determine the importance of HBoV as a cause of lower respiratory tract infections among children admitted to hospital in Singapore. Five hundred nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from anonymized pediatric patients admitted to the Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital for acute respiratory infections. The specimens were tested for the presence of HBoV using polymerase chain reactions. HBoV was detected in 8.0% of the patients tested, and a majority of these HBoV patients exhibited lower respiratory tract infections. A significant level of coinfection with respiratory syncytial viruses and rhinoviruses was also observed in these HBoV patients. The data suggest that HBoV is an important cause of lower respiratory tract infections among children admitted to hospital in Singapore, and is the first study examining the incidence of HBoV infection in a developed country in South East Asia.

"Background: In view of the magnitude and severity of outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus (H5N1‐HPIV) and the threat to public health, there is an urgent need to develop broad‐spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic agents against infection by H5N1‐HPIV and other subtypes. Methods and Results: In the present study, we explored the use of LE‐PolyICLC, a liposome encapsulated double‐stranded RNA, as a possible prophylactic, therapeutic and immune enhancement agent. In a mouse infection model, we showed that the administration of LE‐PolyICLC intranasally before or shortly after infection could inhibit virus replication, leading to a significant reduction in pulmonary viral titres and a higher survival rate of infected mice. When used as a molecular adjuvant, LE‐PolyICLC significantly enhanced both the humoral and cellular responses elicited by inactivated H5N1 vaccine and augmented the protective efficacy provided by vaccination. Most importantly, the data also demonstrate that LE‐PolyICLC could effectively attenuate the development of pulmonary fibrosis during the restoration period at day 14 after H5N1 infection. Conclusions: Taken together, the data obtained in the present study suggest that strong consideration should be given for the use of LE‐PolyICLC as prophylactic and therapeutic agents and also as a vaccination adjuvant to combat highly pathogenic influenza infection and its associated complications such as pulmonary fibrosis.

"The antiviral activities of Houttuynia cordata (H. cordata) aqueous extract against dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN‐2), strain 16681, were evaluated in this study. The results showed that pre‐ and post‐incubation of H. cordata extract (10–100 µg/mL) with HepG2 cells significantly reduced intracellular DEN‐2 RNA production correlating with the decrease in dengue protein expression. In the direct blocking mode, the extract bound with DEN‐2 and strongly inhibited the intracellular viral RNA replication with an effective dose (EC50) of 0.8 µg/mL. Concentrations as low as 10–40 µg/mL of H. cordata extract also exhibited protective effect on virion release from infected LLC‐MK2 cells. High‐performance liquid chromatography analysis of H. cordata extract indicated that hyperoside was the predominant bioactive compound, and was likely to play a role in this inhibition. The extract was also shown to have no genotoxic effect on human blood cells. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Houttuynia cordata is recognized as medicinal vegetable consumed by people in East and Southeast Asia. It has multilateral activities in health promotion and regulation of inflammatory reactions induced by several pathogens. Dengue viral infection is a global health problem since licensed vaccines or specific antiviral drug treatments are not yet available. The current study provides scientific data to support the phytomedicinal properties of H. cordata aqueous extract on anti‐dengue virus in three modes of action (prevention, treatment and virucidal). A major constituent in the extract, hyperoside, seems to be the bioactive compound effectively acting against dengue infection. H. cordata aqueous extract was shown to be nontoxic and hyperoside may be considered a lead compound possessing drug potential for further development.","food"
"Objective: In spite of cytoprotective and anti‐inflammatory actions, conventional licorice extracts (c‐lico) were limitedly used due to serious side effects of glycyrrhizin. As our group had successfully isolated special licorice extracts (s‐lico) lowering troublesome glycyrrhizin, but increasing licochalcone A, we have compared anti‐inflammatory, antioxidative, and cytoprotective actions of s‐lico and c‐lico against either in vitro or in vivo Helicobacter pylori infection. Methods: RT‐PCR and Western blot were performed to check anti‐inflammatory action and electron spin resonance (ESR) and DCFDA spectroscopy to check antioxidative action. s‐lico or c‐lico was pretreated 1 hours before H. pylori infection on AGS cells. Interleukin‐10 deficient mice inoculated H. pylori and followed with high salt containing pallet diets to produce H. pylori‐associated chronic atrophic gastritis and gastric tumors, during which s‐lico or c‐lico‐containing pellet diets were administered up to 24 weeks. Results: s‐lico had fabulous efficacy on scavenging ROS which was further confirmed by DCFDA study and ESR measurement. The expressions of COX‐2, iNOS, VEGF, and IL‐8 were increased after H. pylori infection, of which levels were significantly decreased with s‐lico in a dose‐dependent manner. s‐lico significantly ameliorated hypoxia‐induced or H. pylori‐induced angiogenic activities. s‐lico significantly ameliorated H. pylori‐induced gastric damages as well as gastritis. Our animal model showed significant development of gastric tumors including adenoma and dysplasia relevant to H. pylori infection, and s‐lico administration significantly attenuated incidence of H. pylori‐induced gastric tumorigenesis. Conclusions: Special licorice extracts can be anticipating substance afforded significant attenuation of either H. pylori‐induced gastritis or tumorigenesis based on potent antioxidative, anti‐inflammatory, and antimutagenic actions.","microbiology"
"Proteases play a vitally important role in regulating most physiological processes. Different types of proteases perform different functions with different biological processes. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop a fast and reliable means to identify the types of proteases according to their sequences, or even just identify whether they are proteases or nonproteases. The avalanche of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic era has made such a challenge become even more critical and urgent. By hybridizing the gene ontology approach and pseudo amino acid composition approach, a powerful predictor called GO‐PseAA predictor was introduced to address the problems. To avoid redundancy and bias, demonstrations were performed on a dataset where none of proteins has ≥ 25% sequence identity to any other. The overall success rates thus obtained by the jackknife cross‐validation test in identifying protease and nonprotease was 91.82%, and that in identifying the protease type was 85.49% among the following five types: (1) aspartic, (2) cysteine, (3) metallo, (4) serine, and (5) threonine. The high jackknife success rates yielded for such a stringent dataset indicate the GO‐PseAA predictor is very powerful and might become a useful tool in bioinformatics and proteomics.

"Historical sources for the use of Glycyrrhiza species include ancient manuscripts from China, India and Greece. They all mention its use for symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections and hepatitis. Randomized controlled trials confirmed that the Glycyrrhiza glabra derived compound glycyrrhizin and its derivatives reduced hepatocellular damage in chronic hepatitis B and C. In hepatitis C virus‐induced cirrhosis the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was reduced. Animal studies demonstrated a reduction of mortality and viral activity in herpes simplex virus encephalitis and influenza A virus pneumonia. In vitro studies revealed antiviral activity against HIV‐1, SARS related coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, arboviruses, vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. Mechanisms for antiviral activity of Glycyrrhiza spp. include reduced transport to the membrane and sialylation of hepatitis B virus surface antigen, reduction of membrane fluidity leading to inhibition of fusion of the viral membrane of HIV‐1 with the cell, induction of interferon gamma in T‐cells, inhibition of phosphorylating enzymes in vesicular stomatitis virus infection and reduction of viral latency. Future research needs to explore the potency of compounds derived from licorice in prevention and treatment of influenza A virus pneumonia and as an adjuvant treatment in patients infected with HIV resistant to antiretroviral drugs.

"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) may cause a lethal infection in cats. Antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection has been recognized, and cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in preventing the onset of feline infectious peritonitis. In the present study, whether or not the T helper (Th)1 epitope was present in the spike (S)2 domain was investigated, the ADE epitope being thought to be absent from this domain. Three kinds of protein derived from the C‐terminal S2 domain of S protein of the FIPV KU‐2 strain were developed using a baculovirus expression system. These expressed proteins were the pre‐coil region which is the N‐terminal side of the putative fusion protein (FP), the region from FP to the heptad repeat (HR)2 (FP‐HR2) region, and the inter‐helical region which is sandwiched between HR1 and HR2. The ability of three baculovirus‐expressed proteins to induce Th1‐ and Th2‐type immune responses was investigated in a mouse model. It was shown that FP‐HR2 protein induced marked Th1‐ and Th2‐type immune responses. Furthermore, 30 peptides derived from the FP‐HR2 region were synthesized. Five and 16 peptides which included the Th1 and Th2 epitopes, respectively, were identified. Of these, four peptides which included both Th1 and Th2 epitopes were identified. These findings suggest that the identification of Th1 epitopes in the S2 domain of FIPV has important implications in the cat.","microbiology"
"Due to the potential of a severe pandemic to limit efficacy or availability of medical countermeasures, some researchers have begun a search for new interventions that could complement the planned antiviral‐ and vaccine‐based response to an influenza pandemic. One such countermeasure—the transfusion of pandemic influenza‐specific antibodies from surviving patients to the clinically ill—is the focus of this commentary. Passive immunotherapy, which includes the use of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), hyperimmune globulin, or convalescent plasma, had been used before the advent of antibiotics and has recently reentered the limelight due to the accelerating development of MoAb therapies against cancer, a number of microbes, allograft rejection, and a host of other conditions. After the plausible biologic mechanism and somewhat limited data supporting the efficacy for this modality against influenza are reviewed, safety and logistical concerns for utilization of this potential new product (fresh convalescent plasma against influenza [FCP‐Flu]) are discussed. FCP‐Flu could indeed prove useful in a response to a pandemic, but two necessary items must first be satisfied. Most importantly, more research should be conducted to establish FCP‐Flu efficacy against the current and other pandemic strains. Second, and also importantly, blood banks and donor centers should examine whether offering this new product would be feasible in a pandemic and begin planning before a more severe pandemic forces us to respond without adequate preparation.","hematology"
"A novel human coronavirus (CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. The spike (S) protein of this virus is a type I surface glycoprotein that mediates binding of the virus to the host receptor and the subsequent fusion between the viral and host membranes. Because of its critical role in viral entry, the S protein is an important target for the development of anti‐SARS CoV therapeutics and prophylactics. This article reviews the structure and function of the SARS CoV S protein in the context of its role in virus entry. Topics that are discussed include: the interaction between the S1 domain of the SARS spike protein and the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the structural features of the ectodomain of ACE2; the antigenic determinants presented by the S protein and the nature of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that are elicited in vivo; the structure of the 4,3‐hydrophobic heptad repeats HR1 and HR2 of the S2 domain and their interaction to form a six‐helical bundle during the final stages of fusion. Opportunities for the design and development of anti‐SARS agents based on the inhibition of receptor binding, the therapeutic uses of S‐directed monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors of HR1–HR2 complex formation are presented. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Although human coronavirus (HCoV)‐NL63 was once considered a possible causative agent of Kawasaki disease based on RT‐PCR analyses, subsequent studies could not confirm the result. In this study, this possibility was explored using serological tests. To evaluate the role of HCoV infection in patients with Kawasaki disease, immunofluorescence assays and virus neutralizing tests were performed. Paired serum samples were obtained from patients with Kawasaki disease who had not been treated with γ‐globulin. HCoV‐NL63 and two antigenically different isolates of HCoV‐229E (ATCC‐VR740 and a new isolate, Sendai‐H) were examined as controls. Immunofluorescence assays detected no difference in HCoV‐NL63 antibody positivity between the patients with Kawasaki disease and controls, whereas the rate of HCoV‐229E antibody positivity was higher in the patients with Kawasaki disease than that in controls. The neutralizing tests revealed no difference in seropositivity between the acute and recovery phases of patients with Kawasaki disease for the two HCoV‐229Es. However, the Kawasaki disease specimens obtained from patients in recovery phase displayed significantly higher positivity for Sendai‐H, but not for ATCC‐VR740, as compared to the controls. The serological test supported no involvement of HCoV‐NL63 but suggested the possible involvement of HCoV‐229E in the development of Kawasaki disease. J. Med.

"Most viral infections encountered in resource‐rich countries are relatively trivial and transient with perhaps fever, malaise, myalgia, rash (exanthema) and sometimes mucosal manifestations (enanthema), including oral in some. However, the apparent benignity may be illusory as some viral infections have unexpected consequences – such as the oncogenicity of some herpesviruses and human papillomaviruses. Infections are transmitted from various human or animal vectors, especially by close proximity, and the increasing movements of peoples across the globe, mean that infections hitherto confined largely to the tropics now appear worldwide. Global warming also increases the range of movement of vectors such as mosquitoes. Thus recent decades have seen a most dramatic change with the emergence globally also of new viral infections – notably human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) – and the appearance of some other dangerous and sometimes lethal infections formerly seen mainly in, and reported from, resource‐poor areas especially in parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa. This study offers a brief update of the most salient new aspects of the important viral infections, especially those with known orofacial manifestations or other implications for oral health care.","dentistry"
"Moraxella catarrhalis is a ubiquitous human‐specific bacterium commonly associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including otitis media, sinusitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The bacterium uses an autotransporter protein UspA1 to target an important human cellular receptor carcinoembryonic antigen‐related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Using X‐ray crystallography, we show that the CEACAM1 receptor‐binding region of UspA1 unusually consists of an extended, rod‐like left‐handed trimeric coiled‐coil. Mutagenesis and binding studies of UspA1 and the N‐domain of CEACAM1 have been used to delineate the interacting surfaces between ligand and receptor and guide assembly of the complex. However, solution scattering, molecular modelling and electron microscopy analyses all indicate that significant bending of the UspA1 coiled‐coil stalk also occurs. This explains how UspA1 can engage CEACAM1 at a site far distant from its head group, permitting closer proximity of the respective cell surfaces during infection.","cell"
"The development of peptides with therapeutic activities can be based on naturally occurring peptides or alternatively on de novo design. The discovery of natural peptides is often a matter of serendipity. In part, this is because natural peptides are typically proteolytically cleaved out from precursor proteins, a feature that averts the direct benefits of the genomic revolution. The first part of this review describes attempts to create a more systematic identification of natural peptides relying on a two step process. In the initial step, an in silico peptidome is predicted through the use of machine learning. Then, various computational biology tools are tailored to focus on peptides predicted to have the desired biological activity; for example, activating a GPCR or modulating the cellular arm of the immune system. The second part of the review is devoted to de novo peptide design and focuses on arguably the simplest scenario in which the designed peptide corresponds to a contiguous protein subsequence. Amongst these peptides, those corresponding to helical segments are prominent, mainly due to their relative ability to fold independently. Inspired by the clinical success of viral entry inhibitors, which are peptides corresponding to helical segments in viral envelope proteins, a computational tool for the identification of intramolecular helix–helix interactions was developed. Using this approach, peptides having anti‐cancer, anti‐angiogenic, and anti‐inflammatory activities have been recently rationally designed and biologically characterized. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Background: A detailed laboratory investigation identified bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as the aetiological agent in an outbreak of respiratory disease at a semi‐intensive beef cattle feedlot in south‐east Australia. The outbreak caused 30% morbidity in the resident population and also affected two cohorts of cattle that were newly introduced to the property. Methods: At slaughter, pulmonary consolidation and inflammatory lesions in the trachea were identified in 15 of 49 animals. Pasteurella multocida or Histophilus somni was cultured from 3 of 7 animals with lesions. Histopathological examination revealed multifocal non‐suppurative bronchointerstitial pneumonia with formation of epithelial syncytial cells, sometimes associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia. Results: BCoV was detected in nasal swabs and pulmonary lesions using real‐time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) assay and virus isolation. There was serological evidence of previous exposure to bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, but not to bovine herpesvirus type 1.

"Noninvasive genetic approaches continue to improve studies in molecular ecology, conservation genetics and related disciplines such as forensics and epidemiology. Noninvasive sampling allows genetic studies without disturbing or even seeing the target individuals. Although noninvasive genetic sampling has been used for wildlife studies since the 1990s, technological advances continue to make noninvasive approaches among the most used and rapidly advancing areas in genetics. Here, we review recent advances in noninvasive genetics and how they allow us to address important research and management questions thanks to improved techniques for DNA extraction, preservation, amplification and data analysis. We show that many advances come from the fields of forensics, human health and domestic animal health science, and suggest that molecular ecologists explore literature from these fields. Finally, we discuss how the combination of advances in each step of a noninvasive genetics study, along with fruitful areas for future research, will continually increase the power and role of noninvasive genetics in molecular ecology and conservation genetics.","evolutionary"

"Virus‐like particle (VLP) technology seeks to harness the optimally tuned immunostimulatory properties of natural viruses while omitting the infectious trait. VLPs that assemble from a single protein have been shown to be safe and highly efficacious in humans, and highly profitable. VLPs emerging from basic research possess varying levels of complexity and comprise single or multiple proteins, with or without a lipid membrane. Complex VLP assembly is traditionally orchestrated within cells using black‐box approaches, which are appropriate when knowledge and control over assembly are limited. Recovery challenges including those of adherent and intracellular contaminants must then be addressed. Recent commercial VLPs variously incorporate steps that include VLP in vitro assembly to address these problems robustly, but at the expense of process complexity. Increasing research activity and translation opportunity necessitate bioengineering advances and new bioprocessing modalities for efficient and cost‐effective production of VLPs. Emerging approaches are necessarily multi‐scale and multi‐disciplinary, encompassing diverse fields from computational design of molecules to new macro‐scale purification materials. In this review, we highlight historical and emerging VLP vaccine approaches. We overview approaches that seek to specifically engineer a desirable immune response through modular VLP design, and those that seek to improve bioprocess efficiency through inhibition of intracellular assembly to allow optimal use of existing purification technologies prior to cell‐free VLP assembly. Greater understanding of VLP assembly and increased interdisciplinary activity will see enormous progress in VLP technology over the coming decade, driven by clear translational opportunity.

"The glycome constitutes the entire complement of free carbohydrates and glycoconjugates expressed on whole cells or tissues. ‘Systems Glycobiology’ is an emerging discipline that aims to quantitatively describe and analyse the glycome. Here, instead of developing a detailed understanding of single biochemical processes, a combination of computational and experimental tools are used to seek an integrated or ‘systems‐level’ view. This can explain how multiple biochemical reactions and transport processes interact with each other to control glycome biosynthesis and function. Computational methods in this field commonly build in silico reaction network models to describe experimental data derived from structural studies that measure cell‐surface glycan distribution. While considerable progress has been made, several challenges remain due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of this post‐translational modification. First, for the in silico models to be standardized and shared among laboratories, it is necessary to integrate glycan structure information and glycosylation‐related enzyme definitions into the mathematical models. Second, as glycoinformatics resources grow, it would be attractive to utilize ‘Big Data’ stored in these repositories for model construction and validation. Third, while the technology for profiling the glycome at the whole‐cell level has been standardized, there is a need to integrate mass spectrometry derived site‐specific glycosylation data into the models. The current review discusses progress that is being made to resolve the above bottlenecks. The focus is on how computational models can bridge the gap between ‘data’ generated in wet‐laboratory studies with ‘knowledge’ that can enhance our understanding of the glycome.

"Infections of the airway in children may present to the anesthetist as an emergency in several locations: the Emergency Department, the Operating Department or on Intensive Care. In all of these locations, relevant and up to date knowledge of presentations, diagnoses, potential complications and clinical management will help the anesthetist and the surgical team, not only with the performance of their interventions, but also in buying time before these are undertaken, avoiding complications and altering the eventual outcome for the child. Diseases such as epiglottitis and diphtheria may show diminished incidence but they have not gone away and their clinical features and essential management remain unchanged. Paradoxically, perhaps, some conditions such as Lemierre’s syndrome appear to be making a comeback. In these instances, clinicians need to be alert to these less common conditions, not only in regard to the disease itself but also to potentially serious complications. This article describes those infections of the airway that are most likely to present to the anesthetist, their attendant complications and recommendations for treatment.","pediatrics"
"To explore a method for enhancing the immobilization and hybridization efficiency of oligonucleotides on DNA microarrays, conventional protocols of poly‐L‐lysine coating were modified by means of surface chemistry, namely, the slides were prepared by the covalently coupling of poly‐L‐lysine to a glycidoxy‐modified glass surface. The modified slides were then used to print microarrays for the detection of the SARS coronavirus by means of 60mer oligonucleotide probes. The characteristics of the modified slides concerning immobilization efficiency, hybridization dynamics, and probe stripping cycles were determined. The improved surface exhibited high immobilization efficiency, a good quality uniformity, and satisfactory hybridization dynamics. The spotting concentration of 10 μmol/L can meet the requirements of detection; the spots were approximately 170 nm in diameter; the mean fluorescence intensity of the SARS spots were between 3.2 × 104 and 5.0 × 104 after hybridization. Furthermore, the microarrays prepared by this method demonstrated more resistance to consecutive probe stripping cycles. The activated GOPS‐PLL slide could undergo hybridization stripping cycles for at least three cycles, and the highest loss in fluorescence intensity was found to be only 11.9 % after the third hybridization. The modified slides using the above‐mentioned method were superior to those slides treated with conventional approaches, which theoretically agrees with the fact that modification by surface chemistry attaches the DNA covalently firmly to the slides. This protocol may have great promise in the future for application in large‐scale manufacture.","biotechnology"
"Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PL), α‐amylase, and α‐glucosidase are appealing pharmacological targets for the management of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and obesity‐diabetes. Presently, in vitro screening for considerable inhibition of these digestive hydrolases by endemic Sardinian Pistacia lentiscus L. and P. terebinthus L. leaves and fruits aqueous extracts (AEs) (Anacardiaceae) was undertaken. The AEs PL‐IC50 (µg/mL) in an ascending order were: P. lentiscus leaves; 6.1 ± 0.2<P. terebinthus leaves; 9.0 ± 0.4<P. terebinthus fruits; 125.2 ± 12.1<P. lentiscus fruits; 230.7 ± 38.4. Comparable to acarbose, all different parts of Sardinian Pistacia spp. AEs were identified as in vitro potent and efficacious dual inhibitors of α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase with respective IC50: P. lentiscus leaves; 65.3 ± 7.4 µg/mL<P. terebinthus leaves; 76.5 ± 4.5 µg/mL<P. terebinthus fruits; 237.7 ± 33.5 µg/mL<P. lentiscus fruits; 1.4 ± 0.2 mg/mL. Taken together, Sardinian Pistacia spp. as functional foods and nutraceuticals modulating gastrointestinal carbohydrate and lipid digestion and absorption, maybe be advocated as potential candidate for obesity‐diabetes prevention and phytotherapy.","food"
"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype of the genus Coronavirus. It causes a highly contagious disease which affects the respiratory, reproductive, neurological and renal systems of chickens, resulting great economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. The coronavirus (CoV) main protease (Mpro), which plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication through a highly complex cascade involving the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins, is an attractive target for antiviral drug design. In this study, IBV Mpro was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Crystals suitable for X‐ray crystallography have been obtained using microseeding techniques and belong to space group P6122. X‐ray diffraction data were collected in‐house to 2.7 Å resolution from a single crystal. The unit‐cell parameters were a = b = 119.1, c = 270.7 Å, α = β = 90, γ = 120°. Three molecules were predicted to be present in the asymmetric unit from a calculated self‐rotation function.","crystallography"
"CD4+ T‐helper subsets are lineages of T cells that have effector function in the lung and control critical aspects of lung immunity. Depletion of these cells experimentally or by drugs or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in humans leads to the development of opportunistic infections as well as increased rates of bacteremia with certain bacterial pneumonias. Recently, it has been proposed that CD4+ T‐cell subsets may also be excellent targets for mucosal vaccination to prevent pulmonary infections in susceptible hosts. Here, we review recent findings that increase our understanding of T‐cell subsets and their effector cytokines in the context of pulmonary infection.","immunology"
"Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically triggered after animal pathogens have already infected humans. Are there ways to identify high‐risk viruses before they emerge in humans? If so, then how and where can identifications be made and by what methods? These were the fundamental questions driving a workshop to examine the future of predictive surveillance for viruses that might jump from animals to infect humans. Virologists, ecologists and computational biologists from academia, federal government and non‐governmental organizations discussed opportunities as well as obstacles to the prediction of species jumps using genetic and ecological data from viruses and their hosts, vectors and reservoirs. This workshop marked an important first step towards envisioning both scientific and organizational frameworks for this future capability. Canine parvoviruses as well as seasonal H3N2 and pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses are discussed as exemplars that suggest what to look for in anticipating species jumps. To answer the question of where to look, prospects for discovering emerging viruses among wildlife, bats, rodents, arthropod vectors and occupationally exposed humans are discussed. Finally, opportunities and obstacles are identified and accompanied by suggestions for how to look for species jumps. Taken together, these findings constitute the beginnings of a conceptual framework for achieving a virus surveillance capability that could predict future species jumps.","veterinary"
"The 6th International Conference on Emerging Zoonoses, held at Cancun, Mexico, 24–27 February 2011, offered 84 participants from 18 countries, a snapshot of current research in numerous zoonoses caused by viruses, bacteria or prions. Co‐chaired by Professors Heinz Feldmann and Jürgen Richt, the conference explored 10 topics: (i) The ecology of emerging zoonotic diseases; (ii) The role of wildlife in emerging zoonoses; (iii) Cross‐species transmission of zoonotic pathogens; (iv) Emerging and neglected influenza viruses; (v) Haemorrhagic fever viruses; (vi) Emerging bacterial diseases; (vii) Outbreak responses to zoonotic diseases; (viii) Food‐borne zoonotic diseases; (ix) Prion diseases; and (x) Modelling and prediction of emergence of zoonoses. Human medicine, veterinary medicine and environmental challenges are viewed as a unity, which must be considered under the umbrella of ‘One Health’. Several presentations attempted to integrate the insights gained from field data with mathematical models in the search for effective control measures of specific zoonoses. The overriding objective of the research presentations was to create, improve and use the tools essential to address the risk of contagions in a globalized society. In seeking to fulfil this objective, a three‐step approach has often been applied: (i) use cultured cells, model and natural animal hosts and human clinical models to study infection; (ii) combine traditional histopathological and biochemical approaches with functional genomics, proteomics and computational biology; and (iii) obtain signatures of virulence and insights into mechanisms of host defense response, immune evasion and pathogenesis. This meeting review summarizes 39 of the conference presentations and mentions briefly the 16 articles in this Special Supplement, most of which were presented at the conference in earlier versions. The full affiliations of all presenters and many colleagues have been included to facilitate further inquiries from readers.","veterinary"
"One of the major tasks in biological sequence analysis is to compare biological sequences, which could serve as evidence of structural and functional conservation, as well as of evolutionary relations among the sequences. Numerous efficient methods have been developed for sequence comparison, but challenges remain. In this article, we proposed a novel method to compare biological sequences based on Gaussian model. Instead of comparing the frequencies of k‐words in biological sequences directly, we considered the k‐word frequency distribution under Gaussian model which gives the different expression levels of k‐words. The proposed method was tested by similarity search, evaluation on functionally related genes, and phylogenetic analysis. The performance of our method was further compared with alignment‐based and alignment‐free methods. The results demonstrate that Gaussian model provides more information about k‐word frequencies and improves the efficiency of sequence comparison. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Aims:  To analyse the lung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and correlate the findings with the time sequence of the disease. Methods and results:  Ten patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS, and virological confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection were identified. Histology in most cases showed diffuse alveolar damage, from early to late phases, and the changes corresponded to the time sequence. Other variable features include multinucleated giant cells, pneumocytes with cytomegaly and variable amounts of inflammatory cells and foamy macrophages. One case showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. No viral inclusions were found. Coronavirus particles were identified in pneumocytes by electron microscopy. Conclusions:  The predominant pathological process of SARS is diffuse alveolar damage and, in patients who die from the disease, there is evidence of organization and fibrosis. There are apparently no histological features specific for this disease, and the aetiological diagnosis depends on virological and ultrastructural studies.","pathology"
"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to report the clinical features and outcome of all children with a laboratory proven diagnosis of respiratory virus infection admitted to a university Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Methods: Retrospective study between January 2003 and April 2007 was carried out in the PICU. Every child with a laboratory‐confirmed viral infection was included. Results: 54 viruses were identified in 49 children (27 M, 22 F) over a 52‐month period. The three respiratory virus species, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 17), influenza (n = 13) and parainfluenza (n = 12), accounted for 86% of these 49 cases. PICU admissions due to influenza A (n = 10) were more common than influenza B (n = 3), whereas parainfluenza type 3 (n = 7) was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection. Comparing these three common viruses, the mean age of children admitted with RSV was lower than with influenza or parainfluenza (1.2 years vs. 5.6 years vs. 2.4 years, P = 0.003). Pre‐existing conditions such as prematurity and chronic lung disease were only present in children with RSV infection. These respiratory viruses caused both upper (croup) and lower respiratory tract diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Extrapulmonary presentations were less prevalent and included encephalitis, seizures, cardiac arrest, coexisting diabetes ketoacidosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. One patient with RSV and another with influenza A died during their PICU stay. Nearly half of these patients required ventilatory support or received systemic corticosteroids, and 88% received initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. Approximately one in five of them had nebulised adrenaline, airway endoscopies or bacterial co‐infections. Adenovirus was isolated in four patients and two (both with adenovirus type 3) died during the PICU stay. Conclusions: In PICU, respiratory viral infections were associated with significant morbidity and life‐threatening conditions.

"Environmentally benign oxidation methods satisfy the postulates of green chemistry. Heterocyclic Noxides have applications in synthetic organic chemistry, chemotherapy and agrochemicals. Synthesis of Noxides using green oxidants will be attractive over the conventional methods. The presence of the N‐oxide group in the azine ring makes it more subject to electrophilic and nucleophilic attack and substantially expands the synthetic approaches for the modification of nitrogen‐containing heterocyclics. That is the reason for the increasing interest in the chemistry of heterocyclic N‐oxides. Some reactions adopted for oxidation of N‐heterocyclics have been discussed. Stereochemical and spectroscopic aspects have been mentioned. It will be advantageous if anchored catalysts are employed for industrial exploitation.

"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). It is an enveloped, single‐stranded, plus‐sense RNA virus with a genome of ∼30 kb. The structural proteins E, M and N of SARS‐CoV play important roles during host cell entry and viral morphogenesis and release. Therefore, we have studied whether expression of these structural proteins can be down‐regulated using an antisense technique. Methods: Vero E6 cells were transfected with plasmid constructs containing exons of the SARS‐CoV structural protein E, M or N genes or their exons in frame with the reporter protein EGFP. The transfected cell cultures were treated with antisense phosphorothioated oligonucleotides (antisense PS‐ODN, 20mer) or a control oligonucleotide by addition to the culture medium. Results: Among a total of 26 antisense PS‐ODNs targeting E, M and N genes, we obtained six antisense PS‐ODNs which could sequence‐specifically reduce target genes expression by over 90% at the concentration of 50 µM in the cell culture medium tested by RT‐PCR. The antisense effect was further proved by down‐regulating the expression of the fusion proteins containing the structural proteins E, M or N in frame with the reporter protein EGFP. In Vero E6 cells, the antisense effect was dependent on the concentrations of the antisense PS‐ODNs in a range of 0–10 µM or 0–30 µM. Conclusions: The antisense PS‐ODNs are effective in downregulation of SARS. The findings indicate that antisense knockdown of SARS could be a useful strategy for treatment of SARS, and could also be suitable for studies of the pathological function of SARS genes in a cellular model system.

Like many other areas, infectious diseases pharmacotherapy continues to evolve because of new information regarding disease epidemiology and new treatment options.

"Background  Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a monocarboxylase that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7, is also the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and is highly expressed in the lungs and heart. Patients with SARS also suffered from cardiac disease including arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Materials and methods  We studied mice infected with the human strain of the SARS‐CoV and encephalomyocarditis virus and examined ACE2 mRNA and protein expression. Autopsy heart samples from patients who succumbed to the SARS crisis in Toronto (Canada) were used to investigate the impact of SARS on myocardial structure, inflammation and ACE2 protein expression. Results  Pulmonary infection with the human SARS‐CoV in mice led to an ACE2‐dependent myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ACE2 expression confirming a critical role of ACE2 in mediating SARS‐CoV infection in the heart. The SARS‐CoV viral RNA was detected in 35% (7/20) of autopsied human heart samples obtained from patients who succumbed to the SARS crisis during the Toronto SARS outbreak. Macrophage‐specific staining showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration with evidence of myocardial damage in patients who had SARS‐CoV in their hearts. The presence of SARS‐CoV in the heart was also associated with marked reductions in ACE2 protein expression. Conclusions  Our data show that SARS‐CoV can mediate myocardial inflammation and damage associated with down‐regulation of myocardial ACE2 system, which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS.","medicine"
"Influenza A and B viruses are highly contagious respiratory pathogens with a considerable medical and socioeconomical burden and known pandemic potential. Current influenza vaccines require annual updating and provide only partial protection in some risk groups. Due to the global spread of viruses with resistance to the M2 proton channel inhibitor amantadine or the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, novel antiviral agents with an original mode of action are urgently needed. We here focus on emerging options to interfere with the influenza virus entry process, which consists of the following steps: attachment of the viral hemagglutinin to the sialylated host cell receptors, endocytosis, M2‐mediated uncoating, low pH‐induced membrane fusion, and, finally, import of the viral ribonucleoprotein into the nucleus. We review the current functional and structural insights in the viral and cellular components of this entry process, and the diverse antiviral strategies that are being explored. This encompasses small molecule inhibitors as well as macromolecules such as therapeutic antibodies. There is optimism that at least some of these innovative concepts to block influenza virus entry will proceed from the proof of concept to a more advanced stage. Special attention is therefore given to the challenging issues of influenza virus (sub)type‐dependent activity or potential drug resistance.","pharmacology"
"Interferon‐induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) ıplays a crucial role in the antiviral responses of Type I interferons (IFNs). The role of IFITM3 in the central nervous system (CNS) is, however, largely unknown, despite the fact that its expression is increased in the brains of patients with neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we show the role of IFITM3 in long‐lasting neuronal impairments in mice following polyriboinosinic‐polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C, a synthetic double‐stranded RNA)‐induced immune challenge during the early stages of development. We found that the induction of IFITM3 expression in the brain of mice treated with polyI:C was observed only in astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were activated by polyI:C treatment, leading to an increase in the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines as well as Ifitm3. When cultured neurons were treated with the conditioned medium of polyI:C‐treated astrocytes (polyI:C‐ACM), neurite development was impaired. These polyI:C‐ACM‐induced neurodevelopmental abnormalities were alleviated by ifitm3−/− astrocyte‐conditioned medium. Furthermore, decreases of MAP2 expression, spine density, and dendrite complexity in the frontal cortex as well as memory impairment were evident in polyI:C‐treated wild‐type mice, but such neuronal impairments were not observed in ifitm3−/− mice. We also found that IFITM3 proteins were localized to the early endosomes of astrocytes following polyI:C treatment and reduced endocytic activity. These findings suggest that the induction of IFITM3 expression in astrocytes by the activation of the innate immune system during the early stages of development has non‐cell autonomous effects that affect subsequent neurodevelopment, leading to neuropathological impairments and brain dysfunction, by impairing endocytosis in astrocytes.

"Infectious diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in horses, along with economic costs and broader impacts associated with the loss of members of a species that generates income, acts as a working animal and is a companion. Endemic diseases continue to challenge, emerging diseases are an ever‐present threat and outbreaks can be both destructive and disruptive. While infectious diseases can never be completely prevented, measures can be introduced to restrict the entry of pathogens into a population or limit the implications of the presence of a pathogen. Objective research regarding infection control and biosecurity in horses is limited, yet a variety of practical infection prevention and control measures can be used. Unfortunately, infection control can be challenging, because of the nature of the equine industry (e.g. frequent horse movement) and endemic pathogens, but also because of lack of understanding or motivation to try to improve practices. Recognition of the basic concepts of infection control and biosecurity, and indeed the need for measures to control infectious diseases, is the foundation for successful infection prevention and control.","veterinary"
"A prospective 2‐year analysis including 322 infant patients with acute respiratory disease (ARD) hospitalized in a pediatric department in northern Italy was carried out to evaluate the role as respiratory pathogens or co‐pathogens of recently identified viruses. The presence of respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), human Metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), human Bocaviruses (hBoVs), and human Coronaviruses (hCoVs) was assayed by molecular detection and clinical symptoms evaluated. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 150 of the 322 infants (46.6%) tested positive for at least one pathogen. Ninety samples (28.0%) tested positive for RSV RNA (61.5% genotype A and 38.5% genotype B), 46 (14.3%) for hMPV RNA (71.7% subtype A and 28.3% subtype B), 28 (8.7%) for hCoV RNA (39.3% hCoV‐OC43, 35.7% hCoV‐NL63, 21.4% hCoV‐HKU1, and 3.6% hCoV‐229E), and 7 (2.2%) for hBoV DNA (of the 6 typed, 50% subtype 1 and 50% subtype 2); 21/150 samples revealed the presence of 2 or more viruses. Co‐infection rates were higher for hMPVs, hCoVs, and hBoV (38.3%, 46.4%, and 57.1%,) and lower for RSV (23.3%). RSV was associated with the presence of complications (P < 0.001) and hypoxia (P < 0.015). When the presence of RSV alone and the RSV‐hMPV co‐infections were considered, RSV mono‐infected patients resulted to have longer hospitalization and higher hypoxia (P < 0.001). The data highlight that (i) RSV has a central role as a respiratory pathogen of infants, (ii) the wide circulation of recently identified viruses does not reduce the clinical and epidemiological importance of RSV, and that (iii) recently identified agents (hMPVs, hBoVs, and hCoVs) act as primary pathogens or co‐pathogens.

"The challenge for first responders, physicians in the emergency room, public health personnel, as well as for food manufacturers, distributors and retailers is accurate and reliable identification of pathogenic agents and their corresponding diseases. This is the weakest point in biological agent detection capability today. There is intense research for new molecular detection technologies that could be used for very accurate detection of pathogens that would be a concern to first responders. These include the need for sensors for multiple applications as varied as understanding the ecology of pathogenic micro‐organisms, forensics, environmental sampling for detect‐to‐treat applications, biological sensors for ‘detect to warn’ in infrastructure protection, responses to reports of ‘suspicious powders’, and customs and borders enforcement, to cite a few examples.

"Context: The exchange of health information on the Internet has been heralded as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance. In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so‐called user‐generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease. More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early‐level warnings for epidemics. But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide‐reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century. Methods: This article divides public health surveillance into indicator‐based surveillance and event‐based surveillance and provides an overview of each. We did an exhaustive review of published articles indexed in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Scirus between 1990 and 2011 covering contemporary event‐based systems for infectious disease surveillance. Findings: Our literature review uncovered no event‐based surveillance systems currently used in national surveillance programs. While much has been done to develop event‐based surveillance, the existing systems have limitations. Accordingly, there is a need for further development of automated technologies that monitor health‐related information on the Internet, especially to handle large amounts of data and to prevent information overload. The dissemination to health authorities of new information about health events is not always efficient and could be improved. No comprehensive evaluations show whether event‐based surveillance systems have been integrated into actual epidemiological work during real‐time health events. Conclusions: The acceptability of data from the Internet and social media as a regular part of public health surveillance programs varies and is related to a circular challenge: the willingness to integrate is rooted in a lack of effectiveness studies, yet such effectiveness can be proved only through a structured evaluation of integrated systems. Issues related to changing technical and social paradigms in both individual perceptions of and interactions with personal health data, as well as social media and other data from the Internet, must be further addressed before such information can be integrated into official surveillance systems.","health"
"AKT1, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a critical role in the controlling of intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this study, we investigated whether polymorphisms in AKT1 affect susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms of AKT1, IVS3+18C>T and +726G>A were genotyped in Chinese patients with pulmonary TB by polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment length polymorphism. Patients with pulmonary TB had significantly lower IVS3+18 C/C genotype and higher C/T genotype compared with age‐, gender‐ and ethnically matched controls (P < 0.05). The T–A haplotype frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our result indicates that AKT1 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to pulmonary TB.","immunology"
"Evolutionary biologists have long endeavored to document how many species exist on Earth, to understand the processes by which biodiversity waxes and wanes, to document and interpret spatial patterns of biodiversity, and to infer evolutionary relationships. Despite the great potential of this knowledge to improve biodiversity science, conservation, and policy, evolutionary biologists have generally devoted limited attention to these broader implications. Likewise, many workers in biodiversity science have underappreciated the fundamental relevance of evolutionary biology. The aim of this article is to summarize and illustrate some ways in which evolutionary biology is directly relevant. We do so in the context of four broad areas: (1) discovering and documenting biodiversity, (2) understanding the causes of diversification, (3) evaluating evolutionary responses to human disturbances, and (4) implications for ecological communities, ecosystems, and humans. We also introduce bioGENESIS, a new project within DIVERSITAS launched to explore the potential practical contributions of evolutionary biology. In addition to fostering the integration of evolutionary thinking into biodiversity science, bioGENESIS provides practical recommendations to policy makers for incorporating evolutionary perspectives into biodiversity agendas and conservation. We solicit your involvement in developing innovative ways of using evolutionary biology to better comprehend and stem the loss of biodiversity.","genetics"
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) is a highly pathogenic virus that causes severe respiratory illness accompanied by multi‐organ dysfunction, resulting in a case fatality rate of approximately 40%. As found in other coronaviruses, the majority of the positive‐stranded RNA MERS‐CoV genome is translated into two polyproteins, one created by a ribosomal frameshift, that are cleaved at three sites by a papain‐like protease and at 11 sites by a 3C‐like protease (3CLpro). Since 3CLpro is essential for viral replication, it is a leading candidate for therapeutic intervention. To accelerate the development of 3CLpro inhibitors, three crystal structures of a catalytically inactive variant (C148A) of the MERS‐CoV 3CLpro enzyme were determined. The aim was to co‐crystallize the inactive enzyme with a peptide substrate. Fortuitously, however, in two of the structures the C‐terminus of one protomer is bound in the active site of a neighboring molecule, providing a snapshot of an enzyme–product complex. In the third structure, two of the three protomers in the asymmetric unit form a homodimer similar to that of SARS‐CoV 3CLpro; however, the third protomer adopts a radically different conformation that is likely to correspond to a crystallographic monomer, indicative of substantial structural plasticity in the enzyme. The results presented here provide a foundation for the structure‐based design of small‐molecule inhibitors of the MERS‐CoV 3CLpro enzyme.","crystallography"
"The aim of this work was to show that the leaching process of saponins from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) seeds during washing with water, as is generally practiced by people in South America, can be modeled using mathematical expressions related to Fick's second law. Experimental data were obtained through batch extraction with a ratio of quinoa to water of 1:10 under constant agitation for processing time between 15 and 120 min at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60C. It was found that residual saponin concentration in the quinoa seeds decreased as washing temperature increased. Leaching rate followed the Arrhenius relationship, with calculated effective saponin diffusion coefficient between (5.05 ± 0.15) × 10−10 and (32.50 ± 1.65) × 10−10 m2/s as the temperature increased from 20 to 60C. Several mathematical models to describe the kinetic behavior of the leaching process were analyzed. The modified Henderson–Pabis model had the best fit quality as shown by statistical analysis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: During processing of quinoa for human consumption, a washing process is necessary to remove most of the bitter saponins found in the seeds, as this type of saponin is considered to be a serious antinutritional factor. For industrial scale‐up of this processing step, leaching behavior of the saponin is of crucial importance to find the best design parameters and the most cost‐effective process conditions. This helps reduce energy waste and optimize water flow rate in a continuous washing process. The present study used well‐known models to explain saponins' leaching kinetics from the quinoa seeds with water at different temperatures. The best mathematical model with its justification was also determined, which is generally the most economical way to proceed.","food"
"In Singapore, the military was actively involved in the containment of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) last year. The outbreak started in February 2003 with three Singapore travellers to Hong Kong. At that time, nothing was known about the aetiological agent of the atypical pneumonia that was termed SARS. Unfortunately one of the travellers was a super‐spreader, defined as a person with high efficiency for virus transmission, and was responsible for the expansion of the national outbreak. Not only was the Singapore military involved in contact tracing of personnel and enforcement of home quarantine, military‐affiliated research institutes were also involved in providing diagnostic support. This review reconstructs the events that took place during the SARS outbreak, focusing on the special support arising from complementing the military‐affiliated laboratory with the public health laboratory.

"Background  Hong Kong went through a battle with a new respiratory disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), from March to June 2003. All clinical settings, including rehabilitative and infirmary setting, have actively involved in fighting against the infection. The intent of this paper was to reflect on the SARS precautionary measures that had been taken in a severe intellectual disabilities hospital in Hong Kong. Methods  A review on six SARS precautionary measures were conducted. They were assessment of risk, formulation of operational guidelines, implementation of infection control measures, education and training of staff, conducting audits and carrying out environmental improvement work. Results  Patients were at risk of getting infected from carers, visitors, volunteers, and staff and patients of general hospitals. A SARS Quarantine Unit, isolation ward, was opened to isolate patients who might have had close contact with SARS patients during a stay in a general hospital or when they returned from home leave. Undoubtedly, both staff and relatives participated in preventing the patients from being infected. No day leave and home leave was reported and the number of hospitalization in general hospital was decreased during the critical period. Three infection control audits were conducted and improvement work was carried out subsequently. Conclusion  The practice of grouping within a standard isolation room is recommended to continue in the future. Moreover, intensive infection control training for all staff is of highest importance to safeguard the health of both staff and patient.","rehabilitation"
"Objectives: Recombinant protein subunit vaccines are formulated using protein antigens that have been synthesized in heterologous host cells. Several host cells are available for this purpose, ranging from Escherichia coli to mammalian cell lines. This article highlights the benefits of using yeast as the recombinant host. Key findings: The yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, have been used to optimize the functional yields of potential antigens for the development of subunit vaccines against a wide range of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been used in the manufacture of 11 approved vaccines against hepatitis B virus and one against human papillomavirus; in both cases, the recombinant protein forms highly immunogenic virus‐like particles. Summary: Advances in our understanding of how a yeast cell responds to the metabolic load of producing recombinant proteins will allow us to identify host strains that have improved yield properties and enable the synthesis of more challenging antigens that cannot be produced in other systems. Yeasts therefore have the potential to become important host organisms for the production of recombinant antigens that can be used in the manufacture of subunit vaccines or in new vaccine development.","pharmacology"

"Summary.  The study investigated the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypic resistance profile in 1803 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)‐experienced Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection. Serum HBV DNA was extracted, and the reverse transcriptase region was analysed by a high‐sensitive direct PCR sequencing and verified by clonal sequencing if necessary. Drug‐resistant mutations were detected in 560 of the 1803 patients, including 214 of 490 patients who received lamivudine (LAM), 35 of 428 patients who received adefovir (ADV), five of 18 patients who received telbivudine and 306 of 794 patients who received various sequential/combined NA therapies. ADV‐resistant mutations were detected in 36 of 381 patients who received LAM and then switched‐to ADV in contrast to one of 82 patients who received ADV add‐on LAM. Entecavir (ETV)‐resistant mutations were detected not only in LAM‐ and ETV‐treated patients but also in LAM‐treated ETV‐naïve patients. Double mutations rtM204I and rtL180M were detected more frequently in genotype C than in genotype B virus, and patients infected with this mutant had higher alanine transaminase levels than those infected with mutant containing the rtM204I substitution alone. Multidrug‐resistant HBV strains were identified in eight patients, including two novel strains with mutational patterns rtL180M + A181V + S202G + M204V + N236T and rtL180M + S202G + M204V + N236T. The results provide new information on HBV genotypic resistance profiles in a large cohort of Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection and may have important clinical implication for HBV drug resistance management in China.","virology"
"Some highly pathogenic viruses, such as Chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Hanta virus, SARS‐CoV, and H5N1 avian influenza virus can cause severe infectious diseases. However, the consensus method for detecting these viruses has not been well established. A rapid and sensitive microarray approach for detection of these viruses and a panel of specific probes covering nine genera and 16 virus species were designed. 70‐mer oligonucleotides were used at the genus level and 50‐mer oligonucleotides were at the species level, respectively. To decrease the interference of the host genome in hybridization, the consensus genus primers were designed and used to reverse transcribe only virus genome. The synthesis of the second strand was carried out with a random primer sequence (5′‐GTTTCCCAGTAGGTCTCNNNNNNNN‐3′). The amplified products were labeled and processed for microarray analyses. This microarray‐based method used the highly conserved consensus primers to synthesize specifically the virus cDNA and could identify effectively Chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Tick borne encephalitis virus, and H5N1 avian influenza virus. Using this method, one unknown virus isolated from pig brain in Shanxi Province, China was identified. This method may have an important potential application for the diagnosis of virus infection. J.

"The growth inhibition and cytotoxic effects of theaflavins mixture and pure theaflavins [theaflavin, theaflavins‐3‐gallate, theaflavins‐3′‐gallate and theaflavin‐3, 3′‐digallate] from black tea on human liver cancer HepG2 cells, gastric cancer SGC‐7901 cells, lung cancer A549 cells and acute promyelocytic leukemia K562 cells were investigated. The four major theaflavins were obtained from enzymatically oxidized catechins mixture using preparative high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purity and the structures of the isolated compounds were confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, Liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry (LC/MS), Fourier‐transform infrared, HPLC with diode array detection and thin‐layer chromatography analyses. Theaflavin monomers and mixture exhibited strong inhibitory effects on SGC‐7901 and A549 cells. The obtained TF2A exhibited high inhibition activity against the growth of all four cancer cells examined. It is concluded that individual theaflavins have differential inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines and that TF2A have promising activity to be considered in anticancer treatment research as a drug or a template for drug synthesis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Theaflavins have received much attention because of their potential benefits for human health. In this study, we used a modified method for the preparation and isolation of theaflavins and examined the cytotoxic activity of the individual theaflavins against human liver cancer (HepG2) cells, gastric cancer (SGC‐7901) cells, lung cancer (A549) cells and acute promyelocytic leukemia (K562) cells. Our results demonstrates that individual theaflavins have differential inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines and has the potential to be used individually for functional food applications and for therapy targeting specific cancer treatments. The most active theaflavin (TF2A) is a promising compound that can be used as a drug or a template for drug synthesis for anticancer research.","food"
"Silencing gene expression through a process known as RNA interference (RNAi) has been known in the plant world for many years. In recent years, knowledge of the prevalence of RNAi and the mechanism of gene silencing through RNAi has started to unfold. It is now believed that RNAi serves in part as an innate response against invading viral pathogens and, indeed, counter silencing mechanisms aimed at neutralizing RNAi have been found in various viral pathogens. During the past few years, it has been demonstrated that RNAi, induced by specifically designed double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, can silence gene expression of human viral pathogens both in acute and chronic viral infections. Furthermore, it is now apparent that in in vitro and in some in vivo models, the prospects for this technology in developing therapeutic applications are robust. However, many key questions and obstacles in the translation of RNAi into a potential therapeutic platform still remain, including the specificity and longevity of the silencing effect, and, most importantly, the delivery of the dsRNA that induces the system. It is expected that for the specific examples in which the delivery issue could be circumvented or resolved, RNAi may hold promise for the development of gene‐specific therapeutics.

"Human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). Here we identify the SARS‐CoV spike (S)‐protein‐binding site on ACE2. We also compare S proteins of SARS‐CoV isolated during the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak and during the much less severe 2003–2004 outbreak, and from palm civets, a possible source of SARS‐CoV found in humans. All three S proteins bound to and utilized palm‐civet ACE2 efficiently, but the latter two S proteins utilized human ACE2 markedly less efficiently than did the S protein obtained during the earlier human outbreak. The lower affinity of these S proteins could be complemented by altering specific residues within the S‐protein‐binding site of human ACE2 to those of civet ACE2, or by altering S‐protein residues 479 and 487 to residues conserved during the 2002–2003 outbreak. Collectively, these data describe molecular interactions important to the adaptation of SARS‐CoV to human cells, and provide insight into the severity of the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic.","cell"
"The mucosal surfaces of the genital tract are the site of entry to over 30 different bacterial, parasitic, and viral pathogens that are the cause of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. Women and adolescent girls are more severely impacted by STIs than men due in part to a greater biological susceptibility for acquiring infections and differences in disease sequelae. While it is widely accepted that preventative vaccines against the most commonly transmitted STIs would have a major impact on decreasing the global health burden of STIs for women worldwide, several challenges preclude their development. The female genital tract is a complex niche of microflora, hormonal influences, and immune tissues and cells that result in a mucosal immune system that is distinct from other mucosal sites and from our systemic immune system. An appreciation of these differences and their effect on shaping mucosal immunity to sexually transmitted pathogens is an important determinant for the design of effective STI vaccines. Here we describe the anatomy and mucosal immune system of the female reproductive tract, and discuss bioengineering strategies to design mucosal vaccines that overcome delivery challenges and coordinate the presentation kinetics and compartmentalization of antigens and adjuvants to relevant mucosal immune cell subsets. In particular, we describe recent progress in understanding the role of specific mucosal dendritic cell subsets in facilitating immune responses to pathogenic microbes in the genital mucosa. We also discuss the development of pathogen‐mimicking materials that may be useful for engineering protective immunity in this mucosal niche.

"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a carboxypeptidase that shares 42% amino acid homology with ACE. Little is known about the regulation or pattern of expression of ACE2 in the mouse lung, including its definitive cellular distribution or developmental changes. Based on Northern blot and RT‐PCR data, we report two distinct transcripts of ACE2 in the mouse lung and kidney and describe a 5′ exon 1a previously unidentified in the mouse. Western blots show multiple isoforms of ACE2, with predominance of a 75–80 kDa protein in the mouse lung versus a 120 kDa form in the mouse kidney. Immunohistochemistry localizes ACE2 protein to Clara cells, type II cells, and endothelium and smooth muscle of small and medium vessels in the mouse lung. ACE2 mRNA levels peak at embryonic day 18.5 in the mouse lung, and immunostaining demonstrates protein primarily in the bronchiolar epithelium at that developmental time point. In murine cell lines ACE2 is strongly expressed in the Clara cell line mtCC, as opposed to the low mRNA expression detected in E10 (type I‐like alveolar epithelial cell line), MLE‐15 (type II alveolar epithelial cell line), MFLM‐4 (fetal pulmonary vasculature cell line), and BUMPT‐7 (renal proximal tubule cell line). In summary, murine pulmonary ACE2 appears to be primarily epithelial, is developmentally regulated, and has two transcripts that include a previously undescribed exon. J. Cell.

"The crystal structure of the product of the Bacillus subtilis ykuD gene was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method and refined using data to 2.0 Å resolution. The ykuD protein is a representative of a distinctly prokaryotic and ubiquitous family found among both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals the presence of an N‐terminal LysM domain, which occurs among enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, and a novel, putative catalytic domain with a highly conserved His/Cys‐containing motif of hitherto unknown structure. As the wild‐type protein did not crystallize, a double mutant was designed (Lys117Ala/Gln118Ala) to reduce excess surface conformational entropy. As expected, the structure of the LysM domain is similar to the NMR structure reported for an analogous domain from Escherichia coli murein transglycosylase MltD. The molecular model also shows that the 112‐residue‐long C‐terminal domain has a novel tertiary fold consisting of a β‐sandwich with two mixed sheets, one containing five strands and the other, six strands. The two β‐sheets form a cradle capped by an α‐helix. This domain contains a putative catalytic site with a tetrad of invariant His123, Gly124, Cys139, and Arg141. The stereochemistry of this active site shows similarities to peptidotransferases and sortases, and suggests that the enzymes of the ykuD family may play an important role in cell wall biology.

"Different routes of assembly are probed for the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the bitopic membrane protein Vpu from HIV‐1. Vpu is responsible for the amplification of viral release from the host cell. The mode of action includes (i) heteroassembly with host factors and (ii) the formation of homo‐oligomers, which are able to conduct ions across the lipid membrane. Two different routes of assembling short sequences of the N terminus, including the TMD of Vpu, Vpu1–32, and Vpu8–26, are presented by using a combination of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with a docking approach. The rim of alanines (Ala‐8, ‐11, ‐15, and ‐19) resembles an interlocking motif for the sequential assembly into a dimer and trimer. Simultaneous assembly results in oligomeric bundles (trimers to pentamers) with either tryptophans (Trp‐23) or purely hydrophobic residues facing the center. Bundles, with serines facing the pore (Ser‐24), are energetically not the lowest structures. For pentameric bundles with Ser‐24 facing the pore, no water column develops during a short 25 ns MD simulation. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 99: 517–529, 2013.","biophysics"
"Cell–cell and intracellular signaling are critical mechanisms by which an organism can respond quickly and appropriately to internal or environmental stimuli. Transmission of the stimulus to effector proteins must be coordinated, rapid and transient such that the response is not exaggerated and the overall balance of the cell or tissue is retained. Proteomics technology has traditionally been adept at analyzing effector proteins (such as cytoskeletal and heat shock proteins, and those involved in metabolic processes) in studies examining the effects of altered environmental or nutritional conditions, drugs, or genetic manipulation, since these proteins are often highly abundant, soluble and therefore amenable to analysis. Conversely, the proteins mediating the transmission of the signal have been generally under‐represented, typically because of their low abundance. One mechanism that has overcome this to some extent is the advent of very high‐resolution phosphoproteomics techniques, which have enabled temporal profiling of intracellular signal pathways via quantitative assessment of peptide phosphorylation sites. One group of proteins, however, that still remains under‐represented in proteomics studies are those found in the plasma membrane (PM). Such proteins are crucial in sensing changes in the external environment and in stimulating the transmission of the signal intracellularly. This review examines PM proteins and appraises the proteomics approaches currently available for providing a comprehensive analysis of these crucial mediators of signal pathways. We discuss different strategies for enrichment and solubilization of these proteins and include discussion on cross‐linking of PM complexes and glycoproteomics as the basis for purification prior to proteomic analyses.","biochemistry"
"ABSTRACT Objective: To describe responses of Chinese elderly living in Edmonton, Canada, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, and their use of Western and/or traditional Chinese medicine. Design: A QUAL‐qual mixed method design, using grounded theory as the core method and ethnographic strategies are used to inform the cultural aspects of the study. Sample: A purposeful sample of 19 Chinese elderly was interviewed and tape recorded. Four traditional Chinese Practitioners were also interviewed. Methods: The interviews were transcribed and analyzed in Chinese and later translated into English. Data analysis utilized the constant comparison method. Results: Participants experienced a 5‐stage process of protecting self, family, and others, responding according to the perceived threat of SARS. Participants used both Western and traditional Chinese strategies to combat SARS. Their desire to protect others took precedence under the moral code of filial piety. Once SARS was under control, the community remained vigilant and continued to monitor for its possible reoccurrence. Conclusions: Cultural beliefs and practices within the Chinese population support the recommendations set by the health department for the protection of individuals and the community during the SARS pandemic. Therefore, the public health sector should become familiar with and support these Chinese cultural networks during pandemics.","public"
"A series of Fmoc‐Phe(4‐aza‐C60)‐OH of fullerene amino acid derived peptides have been prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis, in which the terminal amino acid, Phe(4‐aza‐C60)‐OH, is derived from the dipolar addition to C60 of the Fmoc‐Nα‐protected azido amino acids derived from phenylalanine: Fmoc‐Phe(4‐aza‐C60)‐Lys3‐OH (1), Fmoc‐Phe(4‐aza‐C60)‐Pro‐Hyp‐Lys‐OH (2), and Fmoc‐Phe(4‐aza‐C60)‐Hyp‐Hyp‐Lys‐OH (3). The inhibition constant of our fullerene aspartic protease PRIs utilized FRET‐based assay to evaluate the enzyme kinetics of HIV‐1 PR at various concentrations of inhibitors. Simulation of the docking of the peptide Fmoc‐Phe‐Pro‐Hyp‐Lys‐OH overestimated the inhibition, while the amino acid PRIs were well estimated. The experimental results show that C60‐based amino acids are a good base structure in the design of protease inhibitors and that their inhibition can be improved upon by the addition of designer peptide sequences.

"Background  Diarrheal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and animals, including non human primates. While the diagnostics for gastrointestinal bacterial and parasitic pathogens and their etiological role in disease are well established, little is known about the epidemiology, prevalence and role of viral agents in diarrheal illness among monkeys. Methods  We collected fecal specimens from monkeys with diarrhea that were housed in two primate colonies, the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Beijing, China and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Georgia, USA. We screened these fecal specimens for rotaviruses and enteric adenoviruses 40/41 by using commercial EIA kits (Rotaclone and Adenoclone), enteroviruses by RT‐PCR and Southern blot hybridization, and picobirnaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Some of the specimens were examined by EM for coronaviruses and noroviruses. Results  Of the 92 specimens from China, we found 63 (68%) positive for viruses, including enteroviruses (52%), enteric adenoviruses (21%), rotaviruses (20%), and picobirnaviruses (2%). Coronaviruses were detected in some specimens. Mixed infection of two or more viral agents was seen in 23 (25%) specimens. In the US collection, we detected enteroviruses and enteric adenoviruses in 76% (45/59) and 14% (7/50) of the specimens, respectively. Electron microscopy showed norovirus‐like particles in some specimens from both colonies. Conclusions  Our findings indicate endemic infections with enteric viruses in monkeys of both colonies. The availability of new simian rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses and the discovery of noroviruses and picobirnaviruses may allow us to develop better diagnostics for these agents and determine which of these agents are clearly associated with gastroenteritis in monkeys.","zoology"
"Hog‐badgers (mustelid carnivorans classified in the genus Arctonyx) are distributed throughout East and Southeast Asia, including much of China, the eastern Indian Subcontinent, Indochina and the large continental Asian island of Sumatra. Arctonyx is usually regarded as monotypic, comprising the single species A. collaris F. Cuvier, 1825, but taxonomic boundaries in the genus have never been revised on the basis of sizeable series from throughout this geographical range. Based on a review of most available specimens in world museums, we recognize three distinctive species within the genus, based on craniometric analyses, qualitative craniodental features, external comparisons, and geographical and ecological considerations. Arctonyx albogularis (Blyth, 1853) is a shaggy‐coated, medium‐sized badger widely distributed in temperate Asia, from Tibet and the Himalayan region to eastern and southern China. Arctonyx collaris F. Cuvier, 1825, is an extremely large, shorter‐haired badger, distributed throughout Southeast Asia, from eastern India to Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. The world's largest extant badger, A. collaris co‐occurs with A. albogularis in eastern India and probably in southern China, and fossil comparisons indicate that its geographical range may have extended into central China in the middle Pleistocene. The disjunctly distributed species Arctonyx hoevenii (Hubrecht, 1891), originally described within the order ‘Edentata’ by a remarkable misunderstanding, is the smallest and darkest member of the genus and is endemic to the Barisan mountain chain of Sumatra. Apart from A. hoevenii, no other Arctonyx occurs on the Sunda Shelf below peninsular Thailand. The natural history of each species of Arctonyx, so far as is known, is briefly reviewed. No claim to original US Government works.

"Ecological speciation hypotheses claim that assortative mating evolves as a consequence of divergent natural selection for ecologically important traits. Reproductive isolation is expected to be particularly likely to evolve by this mechanism in species such as phytophagous insects that mate in the habitats in which they eat. We tested this expectation by monitoring the evolution of reproductive isolation in laboratory populations of an RNA virus that undergoes genetic exchange only when multiple virus genotypes coinfect the same host. We subjected four populations of the RNA bacteriophage φ6 to 150 generations of natural selection on a novel host. Although there was no direct selection acting on host range in our experiment, three of the four populations lost the ability to infect one or more alternative hosts. In the most extreme case, one of the populations evolved a host range that does not contain any of the hosts infectible by the wild‐type φ6. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that the resulting reproductive isolation was due to a single nucleotide change, highlighting the ease with which an emerging RNA virus can decouple its evolutionary fate from that of its ancestor. Our results uniquely demonstrate the evolution of reproductive isolation in allopatric experimental populations. Furthermore, our data confirm the biological credibility of simple “no‐gene” mechanisms of assortative mating, in which this trait arises as a pleiotropic effect of genes responsible for ecological adaptation.","genetics"
"Vpu from HIV‐1 is an 81 amino acid type I integral membrane protein which consists of a cytoplasmic and a transmembrane (TM) domain. The TM domain is known to alter membrane permeability for ions and substrates when inserted into artificial membranes. Peptides corresponding to the TM domain of Vpu (Vpu1‐32) and mutant peptides (Vpu1‐32‐W23L, Vpu1‐32‐R31V, Vpu1‐32‐S24L) have been synthesized and reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers. All peptides show channel activity with a main conductance level of around 20 pS. Vpu1‐32‐W23L has a considerable flickering pattern in the recordings and longer open times than Vpu1‐32. Whilst recordings for Vpu1‐32‐R31V are almost indistinguishable from those of the WT peptide, recordings for Vpu1‐32‐S24L do not exhibit any noticeable channel activity. Recordings of WT peptide and Vpu1‐32‐W23L indicate Michaelis–Menten behavior when the salt concentration is increased. Both peptide channels follow the Eisenman series I, indicative for a weak ion channel with almost pore like characteristics. Proteins 2008. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","biophysics"
"Synthetic peptide vaccines have potential to control viral infections. Successful experimental models using this approach include the protection of mice against the lethal Sendai virus infection by MHC class I binding CTL peptide epitope. The main benefit of vaccination with peptide epitopes is the ability to minimize the amount and complexity of a well‐defined antigen. An appropriate peptide immunogen would also decrease the chance of stimulating a response against self‐antigens, thereby providing a safer vaccine by avoiding autoimmunity. In general, the peptide vaccine strategy needs to dissect the specificity of antigen processing, the presence of B‐and T‐cell epitopes and the MHC restriction of the T‐cell responses. This article briefly reviews the implications in the design of peptide vaccines and discusses the various approaches that are applied to improve their immunogenicity.

"The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of respiratory viruses associated with severe pneumonia among children less than 2 years of age in the rural district of Matiari in Sindh, Pakistan. This study was a community‐based prospective cohort active surveillance of infants enrolled at birth and followed for 2 years. Cases were identified using the World Health Organization's Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses’ definition of severe pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for assessment by multiplex RT‐PCR for eight viruses and their subtypes, including RSV, influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus. Blood cultures were collected from febrile participants. A total of 817 newborns were enrolled and followed with fortnightly surveillance for 2 years, accounting for a total of 1,501 child‐years of follow‐up. Of the nasopharyngeal swabs collected, 77.8% (179/230) were positive for one or more of the above mentioned respiratory viruses. The incidence of laboratory confirmed viral‐associated pneumonia was 11.9 per 100 child‐years of follow‐up. Enterovirus/rhinovirus was detected in 51.7% patients, followed by parainfluenza virus type III (8.3%), and RSV (5.7%). Of the uncontaminated blood cultures, 1.4% (5/356) were positive. Respiratory viruses are frequently detected during acute respiratory infection episodes in children under 2 years old in a rural community in Pakistan. However, causal association is yet to be established and the concomitant role of bacteria as a co‐infection or super‐infection needs further investigation. J. Med.

The system allows efficient cDNA amplification of SARS‐CoV followed by electrophoretic sizing and detection on the same chip. To enhance the reliability of RT‐PCR on SARS‐CoV detection, duplex PCR was developed on the microchip. The assay was carried out on a home‐made microfluidic chip system. The positive and the negative control were cDNA fragments of SARS‐CoV and parainfluenza virus, respectively. The test results showed that 17 positive samples were obtained among 18 samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from clinically diagnosed SARS patients. However, 12 positive results from the same 18 samples were obtained by the conventional RT‐PCR with agarose gel electrophoresis detection.

"Background:  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease and diarrhea has been reported in up to 76% of cases. The purpose of the present paper was to carry out a retrospective study of the clinical and demographic data of SARS patients with diarrhea in Princess Margaret Hospital. Methods:  From 1 to 31 March 2003, hospital records from 240 patients with confirmed SARS were studied. Patients with watery stool of ≥3 times/day for at least 3 consecutive days were defined as the diarrhea group. Clinical and demographic data were compared between the diarrhea and non‐diarrhea groups. Chest X‐ray (CXR) scores during the peak of diarrhea period were recorded by a respiratory physician. These CXR scores were correlated with the peak frequency of diarrhea by Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results:  Diarrhea occurred in 20.4% of patients after admission. Female patients were predominant with a female to male ratio of 6:1 (P < 0.001) and 69.4% of patients were living in Amoy Gardens Estate (P = 0.01). The proportions of patients requiring ventilatory care and mortality in the diarrhea group were 8.2% and 2%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the non‐diarrhea group (27.6% and 16.2%, P < 0.005). The CXR scores during the peak of diarrhea were not correlated with the maximum frequency of diarrhea (r = −0.09, P = 0.5). Conclusions:  A total of 20.4% of SARS patients had the complication of diarrhea after hospital admission. Both female sex and being a resident of Amoy Gardens Estate were associated with diarrhea.

"Emodin is a natural anthraquinone derivative that occurs in many widely used Chinese medicinal herbs, such as Rheum palmatum, Polygonum cuspidatum and Polygonum multiflorum. Emodin has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for over 2000 years and is still present in various herbal preparations. Emerging evidence indicates that emodin possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including anticancer, hepatoprotective, antiinflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. However, emodin could also lead to hepatotoxicity, kidney toxicity and reproductive toxicity, particularly in high doses and with long‐term use. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that emodin has poor oral bioavailability in rats because of its extensive glucuronidation. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the pharmacology, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of emodin reported to date with an emphasis on its biological properties and mechanisms of action.

"The economics of affinity‐tagging technologies, particularly at preparative scales, depends in part on the cost and efficiency of the bioprocessing step used to remove the affinity tag and obtain the final purified product (Lowe et al., J Biochem Biophys Methods. 2001;49:561–574). When CBM9, the family 9 cellulose binding module from Thermotoga maritima, serves as the affinity tag, the overall efficiency of tag removal is a function of the choice of processing enzyme and the local structure of the cleavage site, most notably the linker sequence flanking the bioprocessing recognition site on the tag side. A novel spectroscopic method is reported and used to rapidly and accurately measure CBM9 fusion‐tag bioprocessing kinetics and their dependence on the choice of linker sequence. The assay monitors energy transfer between a lanthanide‐based donor bound to the CBM9 tag and an acceptor fluorophore presented on the target protein or peptide. Enzyme‐catalyzed cleavage of the fusion tag terminates this resonance energy transfer, resulting in a change in fluorescence intensity that can be monitored to quantify substrate concentration over time. The assay is simple, fast and accurate, providing kcat/KM values that contain standard errors of less than 3%. As a result, both substantial and subtle differences in bioprocessing kinetics can be measured and used to guide bioproduct design. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

"Previously, we reported that proteomic fingerprints were present in sera of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and could separate patients into subgroups with different prognoses. In the present study, we examined the prognostic values of the SARS‐associated proteomic features by biostatistical analysis, and deciphered the identities of those with prognostic values. Data of 20 SARS‐associated serum proteomic features and ten serological variables from 38 SARS adult patients before treatment were subjected to multivariate logistic regression. Proteomic features of m/z 6634, m/z 7769, m/z 8635, and m/z 8865 were identified as independent prognostic markers. After purification by cation‐exchange chromatography and gel electrophoresis, proteomic features of m/z 7769 and m/z 8865 were found to be platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta‐thromboglobulin (beta‐TG) by tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The associations of decreased serum PF4 and increased serum beta‐TG levels with poor prognosis were confirmed by Western blot. Previous studies suggest that PF4 and beta‐TG are involved in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a negative and positive way, respectively.

The hydrophilic antiretroviral drug lamivudine was chosen as a model drug and encapsulated within glycyrrhizin conjugated low molecular weight chitosan nanoparticles (GL‐CS‐NPs) for liver specificity. Methods: First, the low molecular weight chitosan (CS) was synthesized through depolymerization method. The low molecular weight chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by inotropic gelation method. Then glycyrrhizin was conjugated with previously prepared low molecular weight chitosan nanoparticles (CS‐NPs) and conjugation was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy. Key findings: The prepared GL‐CS‐NPs were characterized using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and FT‐IR. The encapsulation efficiency and in‐vitro drug release behaviour of drug‐loaded GL‐CS‐NPs were studied using ultra violet spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatographic methods. Release of lamivudine from the nanoparticles exhibited a biphasic pattern, initial burst release and consequently sustained release. In‐vivo biodistribution study suggested the target ability of GL‐CS‐NPs is better and haematological study shows decline of the tissue damage in comparison with plain drug solution. Conclusion: The experimental results show that the glycyrrhizin conjugated LMWC nanoparticles may be used as a potential drug delivery system with hepatocyte‐targeting characteristics.","pharmacology"
"The previously unknown coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV) affected more than 8,000 persons worldwide and was responsible for more than 700 deaths during the first outbreak in 2002–2003. For reasons unknown, the SARS virus is less severe and the clinical progression a great deal milder in children younger than 12 years of age. In contrast, the mortality rate can exceed 50% for persons at or above the age of 60. As part of the Sino‐European Project on SARS Diagnostics and Antivirals (SEPSDA), an immune phage‐display library is being created from convalescent patients in a phagemid system for the selection of single‐chain fragment variables (scFv) antibodies recognizing the SARS‐CoV.","multidisciplinary"
"The Norwegian Greylag Goose Anser anser population has been increasing steadily over the past few decades, causing increasing nuisance in terms of agricultural crop damage. This, in combination with the importance of Greylags as a hunting target, has called for demographic estimates for the population to assist in management decisions. To this end, we analysed long‐term mark–recapture data using Cormack–Jolly‐Seber models embedded in program MARK to obtain survival estimates for the population. No sex‐specific difference, or age effect on survival after juveniles had completed their first migration (3 months of age), was evident. Mean first‐year survival was reported as 0.485 and annual survival of older birds as 0.700. On a monthly basis, survival in Greylags during summer and winter was very similar over the study period. A significant linear decline in winter survival from 0.909 to 0.807 was, however, apparent during the study period. Over the second half of the study (1994–2002), summer survival was about 3% lower than in the first half (1986–94) but no linear relationship was evident. We found a significant inverse relationship between Greylag survival during summer and latitudinal distribution in Norway. A similar relationship was evident between survival and annual bag numbers. The changes in adult survival observed in this study are likely to have had a substantial impact on the growth rate of the Norwegian Greylag population.","ornithology"
"Atorvastatin is not only an antilipemic but also used as an anti‐inflammatory medicine in heart disease. Our working hypothesis was that atorvastatin preconditioning could improve the forward blood flow in the no‐reflow rats associated with inflammation. We investigated that two doses of atorvastatin preconditioning (20 and 5 mg/kg/day) could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function in rats with inflammation detected by echocardiography and haemodynamics. This benefit was obtained from the effect of atorvastatin preconditioning on improving forward blood flow and preserving the infarct cardiomyocytes, which was estimated by Thioflavin S and TTC staining in rats with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Subsequently, the improving of forward blood flow was ascribed to reduction of microthrombus in microvascular and myocardial fibrosis observed by MSB and Masson's trichrome staining with atorvastatin preconditioning. Ultimately, we found that atorvastatin preconditioning could reduce inflammation factor, such as tumor necrosis factor‐α and fibrinogen‐like protein 2, both in myocardial and in mononuclear cells, which probably attribute to microcirculation dysfunction in no‐reflow rats detected by immunohistochemistry staining, western blot, and ELISA detection, respectively. In conclusion, atorvastatin preconditioning could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function and improve the forward blood flow in the no‐reflow rats attributing to reduction of TNF‐α and fgl‐2 expression.","pharmacology"
"While it is now possible to identify and genetically fingerprint the causative agents of emerging viral diseases, often with extraordinary speed, suitable therapies cannot be developed with equivalent speed, because drug discovery requires information that goes beyond knowledge of the viral genome. Peptides, however, may represent a special opportunity. For all enveloped viruses, fusion between the viral and the target cell membrane is an obligatory step of the life cycle. Class I fusion proteins harbor regions with a repeating pattern of amino acids, the heptad repeats (HRs), that play a key role in fusion, and HR‐derived peptides such as enfuvirtide, in clinical use for HIV, can block the process. Because of their characteristic sequence pattern, HRs are easily identified in the genome by means of computer programs, providing the sequence of candidate peptide inhibitors directly from genomic information. Moreover, a simple chemical modification, the attachment of a cholesterol group, can dramatically increase the antiviral potency of HR‐derived inhibitors and simultaneously improve their pharmacokinetics. Further enhancement can be provided by dimerization of the cholesterol‐conjugated peptide. The examples reported so far include inhibitors of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, henipaviruses, coronaviruses, and filoviruses. For some of these viruses, in vivo efficacy has been demonstrated in suitable animal models. The combination of bioinformatic lead identification and potency/pharmacokinetics improvement provided by cholesterol conjugation may form the basis for a rapid response strategy, where development of an emergency cholesterol‐conjugated therapeutic would immediately follow the availability of the genetic information of a new enveloped virus.

"Zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) to humans causes a severe haemorrhagic fever in afflicted individuals with high case‐fatality rates. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are at present available to combat EBOV infection, making the virus a potential threat to public health. To devise antiviral strategies, it is important to understand which components of the immune system could be effective against EBOV infection. The interferon (IFN) system constitutes a key innate defence against viral infections and prevents development of lethal disease in mice infected with EBOV strains not adapted to this host. Recent research revealed that expression of the host cell IFN‐inducible transmembrane proteins 1–3 (IFITM1–3) and tetherin is induced by IFN and restricts EBOV infection, at least in cell culture model systems. IFITMs, tetherin and other effector molecules of the IFN system could thus pose a potent barrier against EBOV spread in humans. However, EBOV interferes with signalling events required for human cells to express these proteins. Here, we will review the strategies employed by EBOV to fight the IFN system, and we will discuss how IFITM proteins and tetherin inhibit EBOV infection.","veterinary"
"Bats are hosts to a range of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic pathogens. Human activities that increase exposure to bats will likely increase the opportunity for infections to spill over in the future. Ecological drivers of pathogen spillover and emergence in novel hosts, including humans, involve a complex mixture of processes, and understanding these complexities may aid in predicting spillover. In particular, only once the pathogen and host ecologies are known can the impacts of anthropogenic changes be fully appreciated. Cross‐disciplinary approaches are required to understand how host and pathogen ecology interact. Bats differ from other sylvatic disease reservoirs because of their unique and diverse lifestyles, including their ability to fly, often highly gregarious social structures, long lifespans and low fecundity rates. We highlight how these traits may affect infection dynamics and how both host and pathogen traits may interact to affect infection dynamics. We identify key questions relating to the ecology of infectious diseases in bats and propose that a combination of field and laboratory studies are needed to create data‐driven mechanistic models to elucidate those aspects of bat ecology that are most critical to the dynamics of emerging bat viruses. If commonalities can be found, then predicting the dynamics of newly emerging diseases may be possible. This modelling approach will be particularly important in scenarios when population surveillance data are unavailable and when it is unclear which aspects of host ecology are driving infection dynamics.","veterinary"
"SARS‐CoV grows in a variety of tissues that express its receptor, although the mechanism for high replication in the lungs and severe respiratory illness is not well understood. We recently showed that elastase enhances SARS‐CoV infection in cultured cells, which suggests that SARS development may be due to elastase‐mediated, enhanced SARS‐CoV infection in the lungs. To explore this possibility, we examined whether co‐infection of mice with SARS‐CoV and Pp, a low‐pathogenic bacterium which elicits elastase production in the lungs, induces exacerbation of pneumonia. Mice co‐infected with SARS‐CoV and Pp developed severe respiratory disease with extensive weight loss, resulting in a 33∼90% mortality rate. Mice with exacerbated pneumonia showed enhanced virus infection in the lungs and histopathological lesions similar to those found in human SARS cases. Intranasal administration of LPS, another elastase inducer, showed an effect similar to that of Pp infection. Thus, this study shows that exacerbated pneumonia in mice results from co‐infection with SARS‐CoV and a respiratory bacterium that induces elastase production in the lungs, suggesting a possible role for elastase in the exacerbation of pneumonia.","microbiology"
"Sap2 is the most abundant virulence factor expressed during Candida infection, and the principal protein known to induce antibody response during Candida infection in humans. Its role in T‐cell activation however, has not yet been determined. Sequence analysis revealed that Sap2 contains two variable regions: Var1 and Var2. Computational predictions by the Hotspot Hunter program identified that Var1 contains three candidate T‐cell epitopes, whereas Var2 contains four. Thirty‐nine overlapping peptides of Sap2 were then synthesized, and tested for their ability to induce proliferation of PBMC from 12 donors. Peptides P11, P17 and P31 exhibited significantly higher proliferative indices when compared with those of other peptides or controls. P17 and P31 are located in the areas of prediction, while P11 is not. There were other peptides outside the prediction areas that could stimulate PBMC proliferation at low levels. Nevertheless, the proliferative noise caused by such peptides was ruled out by IL‐2 ELISpot analysis. Only P17 and P31 were shown to induce clonal proliferation of IFN‐γ producing lymphocytes, suggesting that these two peptides contain T cell epitopes. P11, which stimulated IL‐2 producing clones, contains a known B‐cell epitope. Interestingly, P17 and P31 elicited both Th1 and Th2 cell responses with significant numbers of IL‐13 secreting clones in response to stimulation. Taken together, the computer‐based T cell epitope prediction method could identify the immunogenic T cell epitopes of C. albicans Sap2 that promiscuously bind to the HLA‐DRB1 supertype.","microbiology"

"The stability of nonviral vectors during freeze‐drying has been well‐studied, and it has been established that sugars can protect lipoplexes during freeze‐drying. However low levels of damage are often observed after freeze‐drying, and this damage is more evident in dilute lipoplex preparations. By investigating the stability of lipoplexes after each step in the freeze‐drying cycle (i.e., freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying), we strive to understand the mechanisms responsible for damage and identify improved stabilization strategies. N‐(1‐(2,3‐dioleoyloxy)propyl)‐N,N,N‐trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP)–cholesterol/plasmid DNA lipoplexes were prepared at an equimolar DOTAP–cholesterol ratio, and a 3:1 DOTAP+–DNA− charge ratio. Our experiments indicate that despite sufficient levels of “stabilizing” sugars, significant damage is still evident when dilute lipoplex preparations are subjected to freeze‐drying. Analysis of the different stages of freeze‐drying suggests that significant damage occurs during freezing, and that sugars have a limited capacity to protect against this freezing‐induced damage. Similar effects have been observed in studies with proteins, and surfactants have been employed in protein formulations to protect against surface‐induced damage, for example, at the ice crystal, solid, air, or sugar glass surfaces. However, the use of surfactants in a lipid‐based formulation is inherently risky due to the potential for altering/solubilizing the lipid delivery vehicle. Our data indicate that judicious use of surfactants can reduce surface‐induced damage and result in better preservation of lipoplex size and transfection activity after freeze‐drying. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 98:3319–3328, 2009","pharmacology"
"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of moisture content on the storage stability of freeze‐dried lipoplex formulations. DC‐Cholesterol: DOPE (dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine)/plasmid DNA lipoplexes were prepared at a 3‐to‐2 DC‐Cholesterol+ to DNA− molar ratio and lyophilized prior to storing at room temperature, 40, and 60°C for 3 months. Different residual moistures (1.93%, 1.10%, 1.06%, and 0.36%) were obtained by altering the secondary drying temperatures. In addition to moisture content, lipoplex formulations were evaluated after freeze‐drying and/ or storage for particle size, transfection efficiency, accumulation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), glass transition temperature, DNA supercoil content, and surface area. Lipoplex formulations stored at room temperature for 3 months maintain TBARS concentrations and supercoil contents. At higher storage temperatures, formulations possessing the highest moisture content (1.93%) maintained significantly lower TBARS concentrations and higher supercoil content than those with the lowest (0.36%) moisture content. Curiously, the intermediate moisture contents exhibited marked differences in stability despite virtually identical moisture contents. Subsequent measurements of surface area indicated that the lower stability corresponded to higher surface area in the dried cake, suggesting that there may be an interplay between water content and surface area that contributes to storage stability. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 98:3278–3289, 2009","pharmacology"
"BACKGROUND:  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease caused by the SARS virus. Current first‐line treatments are experimental, and their effectiveness remains open to question. For more effective treatment and prevention of SARS, human SARS hyperimmune globulins for intravenous (IV) injection were purified in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  A combination of cold ethanol precipitation and ion‐exchange chromatography was used to process pooled SARS convalescent plasma samples. Virus inactivation and removal approaches were taken to ensure safety. RESULTS:  The purified hyperimmune globulins were formulated as a 5 percent solution, with an antibody titer specifically against the SARS virus of 1:83, 1:1600, and 1:200, as determined by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence assay, and neutralizing antibody test, respectively. The purity of the SARS hyperimmune globulins was 99.0 percent, and the monomer and dimer content was 100 percent. Other variables analyzed met the Chinese Requirements of Biologics for IV immune globulin. The  SARS hyperimmune globulins prepared were subsequently approved for clinical evaluation by the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical & Biological Products. CONCLUSION:  IV‐injectable, purified, and concentrated human SARS hyperimmune globulins were prepared from pooled convalescent plasma samples, which are ready to be further evaluated.","hematology"

"The setting of a quarantine time for an emerging infectious disease will depend on current knowledge concerning incubation times. Methods for the analysis of information on incubation times are investigated with a particular focus on inference regarding a possible maximum incubation time, after which an exposed individual would be known to be disease free. Data from the Hong Kong SARS epidemic are used for illustration. The incorporation of interval‐censored data is considered and comparison is made with percentile estimation. Results suggest that a wide class of models for incubation times should be considered because the apparent informativeness of a likelihood depends on the choice and generalizability of a model. There will usually remain a probability of releasing from quarantine some infected individuals and the impact of early release will depend on the size of the epidemic.

"In this study, two structural models (denoted as MproST and MproSH) of the main proteinase (Mpro) from the novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV) were constructed based on the crystallographic structures of Mpro from transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (MproT) and human coronavirus HcoV‐229E (MproH), respectively. Various 200 ps molecular dynamics simulations were subsequently performed to investigate the dynamics behaviors of several structural features. Both MproST and MproSH exhibit similar folds as their respective template proteins. These structural models reveal three distinct functional domains as well as an intervening loop connecting domains II and III as found in both template proteins. In addition, domain III of these structures exhibits the least secondary structural conservation. A catalytic cleft containing the substrate binding subsites S1 and the S2 between domains I and II are also observed in these structural models. Although these structures share many common features, the most significant difference occurs at the S2 subsite, where the amino acid residues lining up this subsite are least conserved. It may be a critical challenge for designing anti‐SARS drugs by simply screening the known database of proteinase inhibitors.","chemistry"
"Current vaccines that provide protection against infectious diseases have primarily relied on attenuated or inactivated pathogens. Virus‐like particles (VLPs), comprised of capsid proteins that can initiate an immune response but do not include the genetic material required for replication, promote immunogenicity and have been developed and approved as vaccines in some cases. In addition, many of these VLPs can be used as molecular platforms for genetic fusion or chemical attachment of heterologous antigenic epitopes. This approach has been shown to provide protective immunity against the foreign epitopes in many cases. A variety of VLPs and virus‐based nanoparticles are being developed for use as vaccines and epitope platforms. These particles have the potential to increase efficacy of current vaccines as well as treat diseases for which no effective vaccines are available.

"Human bocavirus (HBoV) was first recognized in respiratory samples in 2005. The clinical importance of HBoV infection remains unclear. This report describes the clinical features and molecular phylogeny of HBoV isolates in children with acute respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from 1,528 children with acute respiratory infections between 2010 and 2011. Respiratory samples were screened for HBoV by multiplex PCR. A phylogenetic analysis of the HBoV VP1/VP2 gene was also undertaken. HBoV was detected in 187 (12.2%) of the 1,528 patients with a peak incidence of infection observed in patients aged 12–24 months. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was observed in 107 (57.2%) of the HBoV‐positive children. The peak of HBoV activity occurred during the month of June in both 2010 and 2011. A higher previous history of wheezing (P = 0.016), a higher frequency of chest retraction (P < 0.001) and wheezing (P = 0.022), a higher respiratory symptom score (P = 0.002), and a longer duration of hospital stay (P = 0.021) were observed in HBoV‐positive children compared with the HBoV‐negative group. Phylogenetic analysis showed all 187 HBoV‐positive isolates were identified as HBoV 1, indicating minimal sequence variations among the isolates. A single lineage of HBoV 1 was found to have circulated in children with acute respiratory infections between 2010 and 2011 and was associated with several clinical characteristics including age, seasonality, and clinical severity with retraction, wheezing, and longer hospitalization. The clinical relevance of the minimal sequence variations of HBoV remains to be determined. J. Med. Virol. 86:2011–2018, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","virology"
"Viral genomes are compact and encode a limited number of proteins. Because they do not encode components of the translational machinery, viruses exhibit an absolute dependence on the host ribosome and factors for viral messenger RNA (mRNA) translation. In order to recruit the host ribosome, viruses have evolved unique strategies to either outcompete cellular transcripts that are efficiently translated by the canonical translation pathway or to reroute translation factors and ribosomes to the viral genome. Furthermore, viruses must evade host antiviral responses and escape immune surveillance. This review focuses on some recent major findings that have revealed unconventional strategies that viruses utilize, which include usurping the host translational machinery, modulating canonical translation initiation factors to specifically enhance or repress overall translation for the purpose of viral production, and increasing viral coding capacity. The discovery of these diverse viral strategies has provided insights into additional translational control mechanisms and into the viral host interactions that ensure viral protein synthesis and replication.

There are no reports on CERP and human osteosarcoma cells. The present study examined effects of CERP on cytotoxicity including cell cycle distribution and cell death (apoptosis) in U‐2 OS human osteosarcoma cells. CERP significantly induced S phase arrest in U‐2 OS cells in a dose‐dependent. CERP produced DNA damage and DNA condensation. Other effects of CERP were stimulation of ROS and Ca2+, mitochondria impairment, and activation of caspase‐3, −8, and −9. CERP increased the levels of Bax, Bak, Bad, cyclin B, Fas, PARP, GRP78, GADD153, AIF, Endo G, Calpain‐2, p21, and p27, but decreased the levels of Bcl‐2, BCL‐X, XIAP, Akt, CDC25A, CDK2, Cyclin A, and Cyclin E of U‐2 OS cells. It was also observed that CERP promoted the expression of AIF, Endo G, GADD153, and cytochrome c.

"Background: The renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) is a homeostatic pathway widely known to regulate cardiovascular and renal physiology; however, little is known about its influence in gastrointestinal tissues. Aim: To elicit the anatomical distribution and physiological significance of the components of the RAS in the gastrointestinal tract. Methods: An extensive online literature review including Pubmed and Medline. Results: There is evidence for RAS involvement in gastrointestinal physiology and pathophysiology, with all the components required for autonomous regulation identified throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The RAS is implicated in the regulation of glucose, amino acid, fluid and electrolyte absorption and secretion, motility, inflammation, blood flow and possibly malignant disease within the gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies investigating the effects of RAS blockade in a range of conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, functional gut disorders, gastrointestinal malignancy and even intestinal ischaemia have been encouraging to date. Given the ready availability of drugs that modify the RAS and their excellent safety profile, an opportunity exists for investigation of their possible therapeutic role in a variety of human gastrointestinal diseases.

"A seroepidemiologic study was conducted in North China in 2003 to determine the neutralizing antibody titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) convalescent sera. A total of 99 SARS convalescent serum samples were collected from patients from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hebei Province, and Beijing 35–180 days after the onset of symptoms. The anti‐SARS antibodies were detected by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), neutralization assay, and Western blot. Eighty‐seven serum samples were confirmed to be positive for SARS antibodies. The neutralizing antibody titer of the 87 positive sera was analyzed quantitatively by neutralization assay. The geometric mean titer (GMT) of the 87 convalescent sera was 1:61. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test showed that the neutralizing antibody titers conform to normal distribution, which suggests that the average anti‐SARS antibody level in this study was representative of the convalescent antibody level of the SARS population.

"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a newly identified coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in 2003. To detect early SARS‐CoV infection, a one‐step, real‐time quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay was developed that could simultaneously detect nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes of SARS‐CoV with the same PCR condition using either Applied Biosystems (ABI) Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System or Roche LightCycler. The sensitivity of this assay was evaluated using cell culture‐derived viruses, in vitro transcribed viral RNA, and clinical specimens. The SARS‐S, ‐M, and ‐N primer/probe sets described in this paper could detect one to ten copies of in vitro transcribed S, M, and N RNA per test using both the ABI and Roche assay systems. The relative sensitivities for detecting cell culture‐derived SARS‐CoV were 0.01, 0.01, and 0.001 PFU/test, respectively. It showed that SARS‐N has comparable detection efficiencies to SARS2 and SARS3 which are primers sets designed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, SARS‐S and SARS‐M also demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to the commercially available RealArt HPA‐Coronavirus reagents (Artus). The relative sensitivity of these primer/probe sets was also examined using human sera spiked viruses and clinical specimens from four confirmed SARS patients. Similar results as above were obtained. Specificity tests and sequence alignment showed that these primer/probe sets annealed perfectly to 31 isolates of SARS‐CoV; and there was no cross detection with other coronaviruses and human respiratory tract‐associated viruses. Therefore, not only is it compatible with the ABI and Roche systems, this multiple‐gene detection assay also has the merit of being a rapid, safe, sensitive, and specific tool for accurate diagnosis of SARS‐CoV infection.

Close contact with symptomatic patients appears to be the main route of transmission, whereas blood transfusion trans‐ mission could not be ruled out. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) detection kit developed by C. Drosten (Bernhard Nocht Institute, BNI) was used to amplify SARS‐CoV sequences from blood donor samples. We tested 31,151 blood donor samples in minipools of up to 96 samples. To validate the sensitivity of the assay, routine donor minipools (88 ± 8 samples per pool) were spiked with plasma of an imported case of SARS or of a subsequently infected contact person, respectively. Gamma‐irradiated cell culture supernatants of Vero E6 cells, infected with SARS‐CoV, were used as positive controls. RESULTS: None of 31,151 blood donors were positive for the presence of SARS. Two 96‐member plasma pools that were each spiked with 100 µL of plasma of the German index patient or his wife, respectively, were positive. Overall, 0.85 percent of test results had to be considered invalid owing to negative internal controls. CONCLUSION: A real‐time CoV PCR test is able to detect SARS‐CoV in viremic blood donor samples even in the beginning of the disease when patients present minor clinical symptoms. Thus the assay could potentially help to prevent transfusion‐associated SARS‐CoV transmissions.","hematology"
"Antibodies are valuable molecules for the diagnostic and treatment of diseases caused by pathogens and toxins. Traditionally, these antibodies are generated by hybridoma technology. An alternative to hybridoma technology is the use of antibody phage display to generate recombinant antibodies. This in vitro technology circumvents the limitations of the immune system and allows—in theory—the generation of antibodies against all conceivable molecules. Phage display technology enables obtaining human antibodies from naïve antibody gene libraries when either patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. On the other hand, if patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is common to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity‐matured antibodies. Because the phage packaged DNA sequence encoding the antibodies is directly available, the antibodies can be smoothly engineered according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins for diagnostics and therapy is given.","biochemical"
"In this short report we discuss the temporal association between an acute life threatening event (ALTE) and a RT‐PCR confirmed coronavirus HCoV‐229E infection in a 4 months old otherwise healthy infant. More detailed microbiological investigations of affected children even without apparent signs of a respiratory tract infection may help to clarify the etiology in some patients and extend our understanding of the pathogenesis. PCR‐based techniques should be utilized to increase the sensitivity of detection for old and new respiratory viral pathogens in comparable cases.

"Summary.  We have determined the structure of the core capsid of an unusual variant of hepatitis B virus, genotype G (HBV/G) at 14 Å resolution, using cryo‐electron microscopy. The structure reveals surface features not present in the prototype HBV/A genotype. HBV/G is novel in that it has a unique 36‐ bp insertion downstream of the core gene start codon. This results in a twelve amino acid insertion at the N‐terminal end of the core protein, and two stop codons in the precore region that prevent the expression of HBeAg. HBV/G replication in patients is associated with co‐infection with another genotype of HBV, suggesting that HBV/G may have reduced replication efficiency in vivo. We localized the N‐terminal insertion in HBV/G and show that it forms two additional masses on the core surface adjacent to each of the dimer‐spikes and have modelled the structure of the additional residues within this density. We show that the position of the insertion would not interfere with translocation of nucleic acids through the pores to the core interior compartment. However, the insertion may partially obscure several residues on the core surface that are known to play a role in envelopment and secretion of virions, or that could affect structural rearrangements that may trigger envelopment after DNA second‐strand synthesis.","virology"
"Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common cause of viral infection, causing morbidity and mortality among renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α), interleukin‐10 (IL‐10), and interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) have been shown to possess antiviral properties, and their polymorphisms are associated with disease outcome. The aim was to investigate the association of gene polymorphisms in IL‐10, IFN‐γ, and TNF‐α with CMV infection in RTRs. Methods: IL‐10 −1082 A>G, −592 A>C; TNF‐α −308 A>G; and IFN‐γ +874 A>T gene polymorphisms were studied in 247 Hispanic RTRs (52 RTRs with CMV infection and 195 without CMV infection), using DNA‐based polymerase chain reaction with sequence‐specific primers and restriction. Results: Median time to CMV infection was 8 months, with a mean peak CMV viral load of 25,314 copies/mL. Patients with donor‐positive/recipient‐negative (D+/R−) serostatus were found to be associated with a high risk of CMV infection (P = 0.001). A statistically significant correlation was found between IFN‐γ +874 A>T polymorphism and the risk of CMV infection. The IFN‐γ +874 AA genotype was associated with a 3.4‐fold increased risk for the CMV‐infected group compared to the non‐CMV group (odds ratio = 3.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.24–9.34, P = 0.01). The association was independently significant in multiple logistic regression (P = 0.01), along with serologic status D+/R−, acute rejection, and anti‐thymocyte globulin induction. The allelic as well as genotypic frequencies of TNF‐α and IL‐10 did not significantly differ between the CMV‐infection group and the control group. Individuals with IFN‐γ +874 AT and AA genotypes exhibited higher risk of allograft loss. Conclusion: This study suggested that RTRs with variant homozygous IFN‐γ AA genotype were at risk of CMV infection, whereas the high producer IFN‐γ +874 TT genotype appears to be associated with lower risk of CMV infection.","transplantation"
"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections in all age groups and in all geographical area. The role of hMPV in causing respiratory tract infections in Kuwait was not yet investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait among patients with respiratory tract infection with respect to other respiratory viruses. During January–December 2009, 460 respiratory samples from 388 patients with respiratory tract infection were collected from different hospitals. They were tested for hMPV RNA by real‐time PCR, and for other respiratory viruses by conventional PCR. Out of 388 patients, 110 (28%) were positive for viral respiratory infections; 21 (5.4%) were positive for hMPV, 29 (7.5%) were positive for rhinovirus, 13 (4%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus, and 10 (3%) were positive for adenovirus. Most (n = 19, 90.5%) of hMPV‐positive patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 76% of them were of age 2 years and below, and 24% of age 59 years and above. All hMPV‐positive elderly patients had pneumonia while 50% of hMPV‐positive infants had bronchopneumonia. Children with hMPV/rhinovirus co‐infection (n = 3, 1%) had recurrent chest infection and frequent intensive care unit admission. The hMPV infection was mostly detected between December and May, and genotype B was more prevalent than genotype A. This is the first study demonstrating the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait, and suggests that hMPV infection is prevalent in infants and elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

"Nonrandom gene rearrangements have been demonstrated in leukemic cells at diagnosis. These genetic abnormalities are associated with specific types, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of acute leukemia. Common fusion transcripts in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are TEL‐AML1, E2A‐PBX, MLL‐AF4, and BCR‐ABL (p190) and in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) are AML‐ETO, PML‐RARA, and CBFB‐MYH11. Reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for detection of each individual fusion transcript is impractical and time consuming. The purpose of this study was to develop simple RT‐PCR methods to identify common fusion transcripts of newly diagnosed acute leukemia in children. Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow samples of children diagnosed with acute leukemia. Multiplex RT‐PCR panel A (ALL) included primers for TEL‐AML1, E2A‐PBX, MLL‐AF4, and BCR‐ABL (p190) whereas panel B (ANLL) composed of primers for AML‐ETO, PML‐RARA, and CBFB‐MYH11. Known leukemic cell lines were used to serve as positive controls. Eighty three children diagnosed with ALL (n = 63) and ANLL (n = 20) were included in this study. Fusion transcripts could be identified using multiplex RT‐PCR panel A for ALL and panel B for ANLL in 26/83 (31.3%) cases. In ALL samples, we found TEL‐AML1 = 16/63 (25.4%), E2A‐PBX = 3/63 (4.8%), MLL‐AF4 = 1/63 (1.6%), and BCR‐ABL = 1/63 (1.6%). Four cases of AML1‐ETO (20%) and one PML‐RARA (5%) were found in ANLL samples. In conclusion, our simple multiplex RT‐PCR for detection of fusion transcripts in childhood acute leukemia was found to be a rapid, accurate, and effective method.","hematology"
"Aims: The aim of this study was to demonstrate a prototype tool for measuring infectivity of an aerosolized human pathogen – influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus – using a small‐animal model in the Controlled Aerosol Test System (CATS). Methods and Results: Intranasal inoculation of nonadapted H1N1 virus into C57BL, BALB/c and CD‐1 mice caused infection in all three species. Respiratory exposure of CD‐1 mice to the aerosolized virus at graduated doses was accomplished in a modified rodent exposure apparatus. Weight change was recorded for 7 days postexposure, and viral populations in lung tissue homogenates were measured post mortem by DNA amplification (qRT‐PCR), direct fluorescence and microscopic evaluation of cytopathic effect. Plots of weight change and of PCR cycle threshold vs delivered dose were linear to threshold doses of ~40 TCID50 and ~12 TCID50, respectively. Conclusions: MID50 for inspired H1N1 aerosols in CD‐1 mice is between 12 and 40 TCID50; proportionality to dose of weight loss and viral populations makes the CD‐1 mouse a useful model for measuring infectivity by inhalation. Significance and Impact of the Study: In the CATS, this mouse–virus model provides the first quantitative method to evaluate the ability of respiratory protective technologies to attenuate the infectivity of an inspired pathogenic aerosol.","microbiology"
"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is primarily transmitted by bio‐aerosol droplets or direct personal contacts. This paper presents a detailed study of environmental evidence of possible airborne transmission in a hospital ward during the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Retrospective on‐site inspections and measurements of the ventilation design and air distribution system were carried out on July 17, 2003. Limited on‐site measurements of bio‐aerosol dispersion were also carried out on July 22. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the bio‐aerosol dispersion in the hospital ward. We attempted to predict the air distribution during the time of measurement in July 2003 and the time of exposure in March 2003. The predicted bio‐aerosol concentration distribution in the ward seemed to agree fairly well with the spatial infection pattern of SARS cases. Possible improvement to air distribution in the hospital ward was also considered.","public"
"Study Objectives. To distinguish adverse events related to ribavirin therapy from those attributable to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to determine the rate of potential ribavirin‐related adverse events. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Patients. A cohort of 306 patients with confirmed or probable SARS, 183 of whom received ribavirin and 123 of whom did not, between February 23, 2003, and July 1, 2003. Of the 183 treated patients, 155 (85%) received very high‐dose ribavirin; the other 28 treated patients received lower‐dose regimens. Measurements and Main Results. Data on all patients with SARS admitted to hospitals in Toronto were abstracted from charts and electronic databases onto a standardized form by trained research nurses. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between ribavirin use and each adverse event (progressive anemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, bradycardia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia) after adjusting for SARS‐related prognostic factors and corticosteroid use. In the primary logistic regression analysis, ribavirin use was strongly associated with anemia (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–6.1, p<0.0001), hypomagnesemia (OR 21, 99% CI 5.8–73, p<0.0001), and bradycardia (OR 2.3, 99% CI 1.0–5.1, p=0.007). Hypocalcemia, transaminitis, and hyperamylasemia were not associated with ribavirin use. The risk of anemia, hypomagnesemia, and bradycardia attributable to ribavirin use was 27%, 45%, and 17%, respectively. Conclusions. High‐dose ribavirin is associated with a high rate of adverse events. The use of high‐dose ribavirin is appropriate only for the treatment of infectious diseases for which ribavirin has proven clinical efficacy, or in the context of a clinical trial. Ribavirin should not be used empirically for the treatment of viral syndromes of unknown origin.","pharmacology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) papain‐like protease (PLpro), a deubiquitinating enzyme, demonstrates inactivation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 and NF‐κB, reduction of IFN induction, and suppression of type I IFN signaling pathway. This study investigates cytokine expression and proteomic change induced by SARS‐CoV PLpro in human promonocyte cells. PLpro significantly increased TGF‐β1 mRNA expression (greater than fourfold) and protein production (greater than threefold). Proteomic analysis, Western blot, and quantitative real‐time PCR assays indicated PLpro upregulating TGF‐β1‐associated genes: HSP27, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, retinal dehydrogenase 2, and glutathione transferase omega‐1. PLpro‐activated ubiquitin proteasome pathway via upregulation of ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme E2–25k and proteasome subunit alpha type 5. Proteasome inhibitor MG‐132 significantly reduced expression of TGF‐β1 and vimentin. PLpro upregulated HSP27, linking with activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling. Treatment with SB203580 and U0126 reduced PLpro‐induced expression of TGF‐β1, vimentin, and type I collagen. Results point to SARS‐CoV PLpro triggering TGF‐β1 production via ubiquitin proteasome, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2‐mediated signaling.","biochemistry"
"On 23 March 2014, the World Health Organization first announced a new Ebola virus outbreak that started in December 2013 in the eastern part of the Republic of Guinea. Human infections shortly emerged in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. On 30 September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed through laboratory testing the first Ebola virus infection diagnosed in the USA, in a patient who travelled from West Africa to Texas. On 6 October 2014, the first human infection occurring outside of Africa was reported, in a Spanish nurse who treated two priests, both of whom died, and on 23 October 2014, the first human infection was reported in New York City. To date, the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak is the longest, largest, and most persistent one since 1976, when the virus was first identified in humans, and the number of human cases exceeded, as of mid‐September 2014, the cumulative number of infections from all the previous outbreaks. The early clinical presentation overlaps with other infectious diseases, opening differential diagnosis difficulties. Understanding the transmission routes and identifying the natural reservoir of the virus are additional challenges in studying Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Ebola virus is as much a public health challenge for developing countries as it is for the developed world, and previous outbreaks underscored that the relative contribution of the risk factors may differ among outbreaks. The implementation of effective preparedness plans is contingent on integrating teachings from previous Ebola virus outbreaks with those from the current outbreak and with lessons provided by other infectious diseases, along with developing a multifaceted inter‐disciplinary and cross‐disciplinary framework that should be established and shaped by biomedical as well as sociopolitical sciences.","medicine"
"Objective: To identify key nursing issues for paediatric patients suspected of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in relation to the family‐centred model of nursing care and to develop a data‐based model of paediatric nursing care to be better applied in situations of suspected SARS or where outbreaks of other infectious diseases occur. Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive case series, which analysed the medical and nursing records of all highly‐suspected/suspected SARS patients admitted to a major acute hospital in Hong Kong. Key nursing personnel were also interviewed. Results: The study included a total of 17 highly‐suspected and 49 suspected SARS paediatric patients (age: 1–16). None of the paediatric patients was eventually diagnosed of SARS. Most cases presented fever (highly‐suspected: 76.5%/ suspected: 100%), cough (64.7%/71.4%), nausea and vomiting (35.3%/28.6%). Nursing care was provided to the patients as necessary. Both the children and parents experienced fear of SARS, as well as separation anxiety arisen from hospitalization in a strict isolation setting. Conclusions: Infection control overshadowed the family‐centred nursing practices in the management of SARS paediatric patients. A major nursing care issue for SARS paediatric patients was to achieve a careful balance between attending to patients' physical and psychological needs and adhering to the infection control guidelines, while at the same time offering psychological support to family members. The current philosophy and practice of family‐centred nursing model neglect the special needs of children with infectious diseases and predominantly apply to children with non‐infectious diseases that family visits are allowed and nursing care by parents are encouraged.","pediatrics"

"Crown ethers are small, cyclic polyethers that have found wide‐spread use in phase‐transfer catalysis and, to a certain degree, in protein chemistry. Crown ethers readily bind metallic and organic cations, including positively charged amino acid side chains. We elucidated the crystal structures of several protein‐crown ether co‐crystals grown in the presence of 18‐crown‐6. We then employed biophysical methods and molecular dynamics simulations to compare these complexes with the corresponding apoproteins and with similar complexes with ring‐shaped low‐molecular‐weight polyethylene glycols. Our studies show that crown ethers can modify protein surface behavior dramatically by stabilizing either intra‐ or intermolecular interactions. Consequently, we propose that crown ethers can be used to modulate a wide variety of protein surface behaviors, such as oligomerization, domain–domain interactions, stabilization in organic solvents, and crystallization.","chemistry"
"Background and Aim:  Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is endemic in several developing countries. Clinical manifestations of this infection vary widely from asymptomatic infection to uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure. The pathogenesis of this disease and the reason of varying disease severity remain unknown. In viral infections, tissue injury can be caused either by virus itself or by host immune responses directed against infected cells. We therefore studied adaptive immune responses to HEV antigens in patients with hepatitis E of varying disease severity and healthy controls. Methods:  Cytokine secreting CD4+ T cells and antibody‐producing B cells specific for HEV were enumerated through intracellular cytokine staining and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent spot assay, respectively. Results:  Patients with fulminant hepatitis E had a less marked expansion of HEV‐specific interferon‐γ or tumor necrosis factor‐α secreting CD4+ T cells than patients with uncomplicated hepatitis E and healthy controls. These patients also had fewer CD4+ T cells that produce γ‐interferon or tumor necrosis factor‐α upon in vitro polyclonal stimulation. In addition, patients with fulminant disease had a more marked expansion of B cells that can secrete immunoglobulin G anti‐HEV than patients with uncomplicated infection and control patients. Conclusion:  These findings suggest that less‐marked antiviral cellular immune responses and heightened antiviral humoral responses are associated with a more severe disease during HEV infection.","gastroenterology"
"The tragic events of 9/11 and the concerns about the potential for a terrorist or hostile state attack with weapons of mass destruction have led to an increased emphasis on risk analysis for homeland security. Uncertain hazards (natural and engineering) have been successfully analyzed using probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). Unlike uncertain hazards, terrorists and hostile states are intelligent adversaries who can observe our vulnerabilities and dynamically adapt their plans and actions to achieve their objectives. This article compares uncertain hazard risk analysis with intelligent adversary risk analysis, describes the intelligent adversary risk analysis challenges, and presents a probabilistic defender–attacker–defender model to evaluate the baseline risk and the potential risk reduction provided by defender investments. The model includes defender decisions prior to an attack; attacker decisions during the attack; defender actions after an attack; and the uncertainties of attack implementation, detection, and consequences. The risk management model is demonstrated with an illustrative bioterrorism problem with notional data.","social"
"Zoonotic pathogens are significant burdens on global public health. Because they are transmitted to humans from non‐human animals, the transmission dynamics of zoonoses are necessarily influenced by the ecology of their animal hosts and vectors. The ‘dilution effect’ proposes that increased species diversity reduces disease risk, suggesting that conservation and public health initiatives can work synergistically to improve human health and wildlife biodiversity. However, the meta‐analysis that we present here indicates a weak and highly heterogeneous relationship between host biodiversity and disease. Our results suggest that disease risk is more likely a local phenomenon that relies on the specific composition of reservoir hosts and vectors, and their ecology, rather than patterns of species biodiversity.","ecology"
"The identification and characterization of B‐cell epitopes play an important role in vaccine design, immunodiagnostic tests, and antibody production. Therefore, computational tools for reliably predicting linear B‐cell epitopes are highly desirable. We evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained utilizing five different kernel methods using fivefold cross‐validation on a homology‐reduced data set of 701 linear B‐cell epitopes, extracted from Bcipep database, and 701 non‐epitopes, randomly extracted from SwissProt sequences. Based on the results of our computational experiments, we propose BCPred, a novel method for predicting linear B‐cell epitopes using the subsequence kernel. We show that the predictive performance of BCPred (AUC = 0.758) outperforms 11 SVM‐based classifiers developed and evaluated in our experiments as well as our implementation of AAP (AUC = 0.7), a recently proposed method for predicting linear B‐cell epitopes using amino acid pair antigenicity. Furthermore, we compared BCPred with AAP and ABCPred, a method that uses recurrent neural networks, using two data sets of unique B‐cell epitopes that had been previously used to evaluate ABCPred. Analysis of the data sets used and the results of this comparison show that conclusions about the relative performance of different B‐cell epitope prediction methods drawn on the basis of experiments using data sets of unique B‐cell epitopes are likely to yield overly optimistic estimates of performance of evaluated methods. This argues for the use of carefully homology‐reduced data sets in comparing B‐cell epitope prediction methods to avoid misleading conclusions about how different methods compare to each other. Our homology‐reduced data set and implementations of BCPred as well as the APP method are publicly available through our web‐based server, BCPREDS, at: http://ailab.cs.iastate.edu/bcpreds/.

"From 1997 through 2007, human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses resulted in rare, sporadic, severe and fatal cases among persons in 14 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. Of 369 reported human H5N1 cases that occurred from 1997 through 2007, overall mortality was 60%. Ten antigenically and genetically distinct clades of H5N1 viruses have been identified to date, and strains from four clades have infected humans. Surveillance has focused upon hospitalized cases of febrile acute lower respiratory tract disease among persons with exposure to sick or dead poultry, or to a human H5N1 case. Detection of H5N1 virus infection is based primarily upon collection of respiratory tract specimens from suspected cases for RT‐PCR testing. Most human H5N1 cases were previously healthy children or young adults who developed severe acute pulmonary or multi‐organ disease following direct or close contact with sick or dead H5N1 virus–infected poultry. Occasional clusters of H5N1 cases have occurred, predominantly among blood‐related family members. Limited human‐to‐human H5N1 virus transmission has been reported or could not be excluded in some clusters. The frequency of asymptomatic or clinically mild H5N1 virus infection is unknown, but limited investigations suggest that such infections have been rare since 2003. There is no evidence of sustained human‐to‐human H5N1 virus spread. However, H5N1 viruses continue to circulate and evolve among poultry in many countries, and there are many unanswered questions about human infection with H5N1 viruses. Thus, the pandemic influenza threat presented by H5N1 viruses persists.","respiratory"
"Background: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a possible key determinant of progressive fibrosis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a powerful tool for silencing gene expression post‐transcriptionally. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether synthetic siRNA target CTGF down‐regulates the expression of the CTGF gene in primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and HSC T6, and, furthermore, whether it prevents rat HSC activation and extracelluar matrix (ECM) production. Methods: Primary HSC were obtained by enzymatic perfusion of rat liver. HSC T6, primary HSC were treated with siRNAs that target CTGF or a control siRNA by addition to the culture medium. Results: We obtained one siRNA that could sequence‐specifically reduce target gene expression by over 90% at a concentration of 200 nM in the cell culture medium for a total of three siRNAs targeting CTGF genes. In HSC T6 cells, the effect of CTGF siRNA was dose‐dependent (50–200 nM) and time‐limited to a 24–72‐h period. The siRNA knockdown of CTGF significantly reduced the expression of α‐smooth muscle actin protein, increased the number of cells, upregulated the ratios of G0/G1 stage in rat HSC at 7 days of culture after plating, and attenuated the expression of type I and III collagen mRNA with a supernatant concentration of hyaluronic acid, and type III procollagen in an activated HSC of culture for 24–72 h. Conclusions: CTGF siRNA could effectively and sequence‐specifically down‐regulate the expression of CTGF in rat HSC, resulting in significant inhibition of HSC activation and proliferation as well as ECM production. These findings indicate that synthetic siRNA targeting CTGF could prove to be a useful treatment of liver fibrosis. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","medicine"

"The aetiologic agent of the recent epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a positive‐stranded RNA virus (SARS‐CoV) belonging to the Coronaviridae family and its genome differs substantially from those of other known coronaviruses. SARS‐CoV is transmissible mainly by the respiratory route and to date there is no vaccine and no prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against this agent. A SARS‐CoV whole‐genome approach has been developed aimed at determining the crystal structure of all of its proteins or domains. These studies are expected to greatly facilitate drug design. The genomes of coronaviruses are between 27 and 31.5 kbp in length, the largest of the known RNA viruses, and encode 20–30 mature proteins. The functions of many of these polypeptides, including the Nsp9–Nsp10 replicase‐cleavage products, are still unknown. Here, the cloning, Escherichia coli expression, purification and crystallization of the SARS‐CoV Nsp9 protein, the first SARS‐CoV protein to be crystallized, are reported. Nsp9 crystals diffract to 2.8 Å resolution and belong to space group P61/522, with unit‐cell parameters a = b = 89.7, c = 136.7 Å. With two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the solvent content is 60% (VM = 3.1 Å3 Da−1).","crystallography"
"Valinomycin was recently reported to be the most potent agent against severe acute respiratory‐syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in infected Vero E6 cells. Aimed at generating analogues by metabolic engineering, the valinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned from Streptomyces tsusimaensis ATCC 15141. Targeted disruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene abolishes valinomycin production, which confirms its predicted nonribosomal‐peptide origin. Sequence analysis of the NRPS system reveals four distinctive modules, two of which contain unusual domain organizations that are presumably involved in the generation of biosynthetic precursors D‐α‐hydroxyisovaleric acid and L‐lactic acid. The respective adenylation domains in these two modules contain novel substrate‐specificity‐conferring codes that might specify for a class of hydroxyl acids for the biosynthesis of the depsipeptide natural products.","chemistry"
"Nurses regularly are exposed to a variety of occupational hazards. In addition to documented occupational hazards, exposure to smoking remains a major concern. This article reviews the prevalence of smoking among nurses working in the United States and discusses their reasons for smoking. Researchers conducted a state‐of‐the‐art review on the effects of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) on the immune system. Smoking prevalence among nurses working in the United States ranged from 7%–12%, and high work stress, poor work environment, shift work, and peer influence were suspected major risk factors influencing smoking behavior. A review of the effects of smoking on immunity revealed that both active smoking and exposure to SHS negatively affects immune function. When rehabilitation nurses stop smoking, their health improves and nonsmokers are exposed to less SHS. Rehabilitation nurses are encouraged to share knowledge of the immunological benefits of smoking cessation with patients to facilitate nurse‐led rehabilitation programs.","rehabilitation"
"We challenge the concept of idiopathic parkinsonism (IP) as inevitably progressive neurodegeneration, proposing a natural history of sequential microbial insults with predisposing host response. Proof‐of‐principle that infection can contribute to IP was provided by case studies and a placebo‐controlled efficacy study of Helicobacter eradication. “Malignant” IP appears converted to “benign”, but marked deterioration accompanies failure. Similar benefit on brady/hypokinesia from eradicating “low‐density” infection favors autoimmunity. Although a minority of UK probands are urea breath test positive for Helicobacter, the predicted probability of having the parkinsonian label depends on the serum H. pylori antibody profile, with clinically relevant gradients between this “discriminant index” and disease burden and progression. In IP, H. pylori antibodies discriminate for persistently abnormal bowel function, and specific abnormal duodenal enterocyte mitochondrial morphology is described in relation to H. pylori infection. Slow intestinal transit manifests as constipation from the prodrome. Diarrhea may flag secondary small‐intestinal bacterial overgrowth. This, coupled with genetically determined intense inflammatory response, might explain evolution from brady/hypokinetic to rigidity‐predominant parkinsonism.","microbiology"
"Obvious spatial infection patterns are often observed in cases associated with airborne transmissible diseases. Existing quantitative infection risk assessment models analyze the observed cases by assuming a homogeneous infectious particle concentration and ignore the spatial infection pattern, which may cause errors. This study aims at developing an approach to analyze spatial infection patterns associated with infectious respiratory diseases or other airborne transmissible diseases using infection risk assessment and likelihood estimation. Mathematical likelihood, based on binomial probability, was used to formulate the retrospective component with some additional mathematical treatments. Together with an infection risk assessment model that can address spatial heterogeneity, the method can be used to analyze the spatial infection pattern and retrospectively estimate the influencing parameters causing the cases, such as the infectious source strength of the pathogen. A Varicella outbreak was selected to demonstrate the use of the new approach. The infectious source strength estimated by the Wells‐Riley concept using the likelihood estimation was compared with the estimation using the existing method. It was found that the maximum likelihood estimation matches the epidemiological observation of the outbreak case much better than the estimation under the assumption of homogeneous infectious particle concentration. Influencing parameters retrospectively estimated using the new approach can be used as input parameters in quantitative infection risk assessment of the disease under other scenarios. The approach developed in this study can also serve as an epidemiological tool in outbreak investigation. Limitations and further developments are also discussed.","social"
"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) can induce cell transformation and tumourigenesis, but the mechanism is not understood. Previous studies have suggested that LMP1 acts through up‐regulation of cellular proliferation pathways including the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, in which β‐catenin is the central effector. Increased levels of β‐catenin coupled with a decrease in E‐cadherin lead to reduced cell adhesion. This pathway is antagonized by WTX (Wilms' tumour gene on the X chromosome), which can promote the ubiquitination and degradation of β‐catenin. In the present study, we established L2/LMP1B95 − 8/EGFP transgenic mice to investigate the in vivo role of LMP1. Down‐regulation of WTX and E‐cadherin was accompanied by increased expression of β‐catenin in these mice. Even though invasive tumours did not develop, dysplasia was seen in the nasopharynx and oropharynx epithelium of these transgenic mice. Analysis of LMP1+, WTX+, and LMP1 siRNA silenced HNE‐1 cell lines demonstrated that WTX could exert a dominant role in LMP1‐mediated WNT/β‐catenin pathway regulation. This study indicates that LMP1 antagonizes the WNT/β‐catenin pathway by inhibiting WTX, and this reduction in WTX is associated with epithelial dysplasia via regulation of the WNT/β‐catenin pathway molecules E‐cadherin and β‐catenin. Further studies are required for a better understanding of the relationship between LMP1‐mediated antagonization of the WNT/β‐catenin pathway and tumourigenesis.

"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) is the main active component of tea polyphenol and shows several biological activities, such as antimicrobial, antitumor‐promoting, anti‐inflammatory and anti‐oxidative activities. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of EGCg on bovine coronavirus (BCV) propagation in Madin‐Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells was investigated. EGCg at concentrations of less than 10 µg/mL did not show any cytotoxicity to MDBK cells. BCV propagation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the virus with EGCg (0.5–10 µg/mL) before virus inoculation in dose‐dependent, incubation time‐dependent and temperature‐dependent manners. The antiviral effect of pretreating MDBK cells with EGCg on BCV propagation was much weaker than that of pretreating BCV with EGCg. The hemagglutination activity of BCV was also reduced by EGCg in a dose‐dependent manner. These results demonstrate that EGCg possesses a distinct anti‐BCV activity and strongly suggest that EGCg interferes with the adsorption of BCV to MDBK cells by the interaction of EGCg with BCV particles. EGCg may therefore be a useful candidate for controlling BCV infection more effectively.","agriculture"
"The aim of the present study was to determine whether bovine coronavirus (BCV) has the ability to initiate infection in a human colon carcinoma cell line, Caco‐2, that has been established to spontaneously differentiate after confluence. When Caco‐2 cells were infected with BCV, a titer of 5.5 × 106 plaque‐forming units (p.f.u.)/mL was found in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection. Two clones, Caco‐2/CA1 and Caco‐2/CA2, were then isolated by monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cell proliferation activities. The ALP activity level of CA1 cells was significantly higher than that of CA2 cells, while the level of cell proliferation activity of CA1 was significantly lower than that of CA2. When CA1 and CA2 cells were infected with BCV at confluence, virus hemagglutination (HA) was detected in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection for CA1 cells and at 8 days postinfection for CA2 cells. Thus, BCV propagation was substantially delayed in CA2 cells, suggesting that a cellular factor(s) that appears at the differentiation stage may control BCV propagation. BCV‐susceptible CA1 and CA2 cells showing different levels of ALP activity would be useful for further experiments to elucidate the mechanism of BCV propagation.","agriculture"
"Objective  Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, many survivors were observed to suffer from psychosomatic symptoms reminiscent of various endocrine disorders. Hence, we sought to determine the existence of any chronic endocrine sequelae in SARS survivors. Design, patients, measurements  Sixty‐one survivors of SARS prospectively recruited were analysed for hormonal derangements 3 months following recovery. Patients with pre‐existing endocrine disorders were excluded. Any endocrine abnormalities diagnosed were investigated and treated where indicated up to a year. Serial evaluation facilitated characterization of trends and prognostication of any endocrinological aberrations. Results  Twenty‐four (39·3%) patients had evidence of hypocortisolism. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction of the majority resolved within a year. Two (3·3%) of the hypocortisolic cohort had transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Four (6·7%) were biochemically hypothyroid, being comprised of three with central hypothyroidism and one with primary hypothyroidism. Two of the three with central hypothyroidism had concomitant central hypocortisolism. Eight had subnormal DHEAS levels. Conclusions  These preliminary findings highlight a possible aetiologic role of SARS‐associated coronavirus in causing a reversible hypophysitis or direct hypothalamic effect, with the HPA axis affected more frequently than the HPT axis.","endocrinology"
"The roots and rhizomes of licorice (Glycyrrhiza) species have long been used worldwide as a herbal medicine and natural sweetener. Licorice root is a traditional medicine used mainly for the treatment of peptic ulcer, hepatitis C, and pulmonary and skin diseases, although clinical and experimental studies suggest that it has several other useful pharmacological properties such as antiinflammatory, antiviral, antimicrobial, antioxidative, anticancer activities, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective and cardioprotective effects. A large number of components have been isolated from licorice, including triterpene saponins, flavonoids, isoflavonoids and chalcones, with glycyrrhizic acid normally being considered to be the main biologically active component. This review summarizes the phytochemical, pharmacological and pharmacokinetics data, together with the clinical and adverse effects of licorice and its bioactive components.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first reported in China, and spread to 29 regions, affecting over 8000 people worldwide. For the general public, the psychological impact of SARS may have been greater than the physical health danger of the disease. The present paper proposes the influence of psychological factors on people's cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses during the SARS outbreak. The various papers in this special issue of the Journal reveal how people have reacted during the SARS outbreak: People's general coping styles may be related to their health behavior during the outbreak. Cultural differences were evident in the perception of SARS, and individuals’ perceptual styles may have influenced their ability to cope with the outbreak. The way in which individuals coped with SARS‐related stressful events was different from their usual practices of managing daily stress. Individual differences in the adoption of preventive measures were related to the distinct susceptibility to several social‐cognitive biases.","psychology"
"DnaK is a member of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones. This molecular machine couples the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to binding and release of substrate proteins. The switches that are involved in allosteric communication within this multidomain protein are mostly unknown. Previous insights were largely obtained by mutants, which displayed either wild‐type activity or reduced folding assistance of substrate proteins. With a directed evolution approach for improved folding assistance we selected a DnaK variant characterized by a glycine to alanine substitution at position 384 (G384A); this resulted in a 2.5‐fold higher chaperone activity in an in vitro DnaK‐assisted firefly luciferase refolding assay. Quantitative biochemical characterization revealed several changes of key kinetic parameters compared to the wild type. Most pronounced is a 13‐fold reduced rate constant for substrate release in the ATP‐bound state, which we assume, in conjunction with the resulting increase in substrate affinity, to be related to improved chaperone activity. As the underlying mechanistic reason for this change we propose an altered interface of allosteric communication of mutant G384A, which is notably located at a hinge position between nucleotide and substrate binding domain.","chemistry"
"The dynamic behavior of monomeric Vpu1‐32 from HIV‐1 in different lipid environments has been studied.

"A large‐scale, high‐efficiency and low‐cost platform based on a Beckman Coulter Biomek FX and custom‐made automation systems for structural genomics has been set up at Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China. This platform has the capacity to process up to 2000 genes per year for structural and functional analyses. Bacillus subtilis, a model organism for Gram‐positive bacteria, and Streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen of dental caries, were selected as the main targets. To date, more than 470 B. subtilis and 1200 S. mutans proteins and hundreds of proteins from other sources, including human liver proteins, have been selected as targets for this platform. The selected genes are mainly related to important metabolism pathways and/or have potential relevance for drug design. To date, 40 independent structures have been determined; of these 11 are in the category of novel structures by the criterion of having less than 30% sequence identity to known structures. More than 13 structures were determined by SAD/MAD phasing. The macromolecular crystallography beamline at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility and modern phasing programs have been crucial components of the operation of the platform. The idea and practice of the genomic approach have been successfully adopted in a moderately funded structural biology program and it is believed this adaptation will greatly improve the production of protein structures. The goal is to be able to solve a protein structure of moderate difficulty at a cost about US $10 000.","crystallography"
"This prospective clinical and virological study of 2,060 otherwise healthy children aged <15 years of age (1,112 males; mean age ± SD, 3.46 ± 3.30 years) who attended the Emergency Department of Milan University's Institute of Pediatrics because of an acute disease excluding trauma during the winter season 2003–2004 was designed to compare the prevalence and clinical importance of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in children. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed HCoV infection in 79 cases (3.8%): 33 HCoV‐229E (1.6%), 13 HCoV‐NL63 (0.6%), 11 HCoV‐OC43 (0.5%), none HCoV‐HKU1 genotype A, and 22 (1.1%) co‐detections of a HCoV and another respiratory virus. The HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper respiratory tract infection; there was no significant difference in clinical presentation between single HCoV infections and HCoV co‐infections. Diagnostic methods were used in a limited number of patients, and the therapy prescribed and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of the viral strain. There were a few cases of other members of the households of HCoV‐positive children falling ill during the 5–7 days following enrollment. These findings suggest that HCoV‐229E and HCoV‐OC43 have a limited clinical and socioeconomic impact on otherwise healthy children and their household contacts, and the HCoV‐NL63 identified recently does not seem to be any different. The quantitative and qualitative role of HCoV‐HKU1 genotype A is apparently very marginal. J. Med. Virol. 78:1609–1615, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"Background and Objectives: The recent establishment of the National Healthcare Safety Network Hemovigilance Module in the United States affords an opportunity to compare results with those of other developed nations. Materials and Methods: Using data from national haemovigilance systems, reactions associated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and residual risks of transfusion‐transmitted infectious diseases were assembled from 17 nations. Country‐specific rates of adverse events were pooled using random‐effects Poisson regression. Results: Febrile non‐haemolytic and delayed serologic transfusion reactions were the most frequent adverse events reported after RBC transfusion, occurring in 26 patients per 100 000 RBC units and 25 patients per 100 000 RBC units administered, respectively. Rates of allergic, febrile non‐haemolytic and delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions in the United States were significantly greater than the pooled rates from other countries. Frequencies of adverse events generated from the national haemovigilance programme in the United States were considerably lower than when obtained through active surveillance. Conclusion: Haemovigilance reports of adverse events in the United States are comparable to, or greater than, reports from other developed countries. Rates generated from haemovigilance programmes are lower than those obtained through active surveillance. The lack of universal leucoreduction of RBC units may be a contributing factor to the higher rate of some adverse events in the United States.","hematology"

"Few post‐mortem studies have been performed on patients who have died from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). No studies have examined how the SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) loads in different organs with respect to time, post‐mortem. The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative temporal‐spatial distribution of SARS‐CoV in the post‐mortem tissue samples of seven patients. Quantitation of a house‐keeping gene, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was undertaken to standardize the amount of tissue tested. SARS‐CoV viral load and SARS‐CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio for each organ type were related to four time durations: onset of illness to death, death to post‐mortem tissue sampling, and total durations of treatment with ribavirin and hydrocortisone. The SARS‐CoV/GAPDH RNA ratio remained relatively stable in most organ tissue types for all these time durations. The ratio reached the highest value of equal to or greater than one for lung and small bowel, whereas those for heart, liver, spleen, and kidney were always less than one. It is concluded that SARS‐CoV viral loads in these organs remain relatively stable, post‐mortem. This quantitative assessment further supports SARS‐CoV has a specific tropism for the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which may be related to the density of SARS‐CoV receptors. J. Med.

"Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to survey nursing students’ Middle East respiratory syndrome–related knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception to examine the correlations among the variables during a Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome is a new viral respiratory illness. Nursing students who engage in clinical practice at hospitals may have been exposed to Middle East respiratory syndrome infection during the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. Design: This study was a descriptive cross‐sectional survey. Methods: Participants (n = 249) were nursing students in their third or fourth year of the programme who were engaged in clinical practice for eight hours per day at the tertiary hospitals with Middle East respiratory syndrome patients. Knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception related to Middle East respiratory syndrome were measured using scales developed through a preliminary survey and validity testing. Results: The subjects’ knowledge level of Middle East respiratory syndrome was 84·4%; their practice of preventive behaviours was rated at 44·5%; and their risk perception rating was 2·4 out of 5. Middle East respiratory syndrome–related risk perception was significantly different according to gender and Middle East respiratory syndrome education. Middle East respiratory syndrome–related knowledge was significantly correlated with preventive behaviours and risk perception. Conclusion: Considering the low scores for items regarding knowledge and preventive behaviours, it is necessary to develop effective and systematic publicity and education programmes for nursing students. Enhancing Middle East respiratory syndrome–related knowledge by considering cooperation between hospitals and universities will sharpen nursing students’ risk perception of the disease and effectively increase their preventive behaviours. Relevance to clinical practice: Similar to other emerging infectious diseases, Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks may occur in other countries. The results of this study can be used to develop and apply efficient and feasible Middle East respiratory syndrome education programmes for nursing students during Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks.","nursing"
"West Nile virus (WNV) has been responsible for the largest outbreaks of arboviral encephalitis in U.S. history. No specific drug is currently available for the effective treatment of WNV infection. To exploit RNA interference as a potential therapeutic approach, a Moloney murine leukemia virus‐based retrovirus vector was used to effectively deliver WNV‐specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) into human neuroblastoma HTB‐11 cells. Viral plaque assays demonstrated that transduced cells were significantly refractory to WNV replication, as compared to untransduced control cells (P < 0.05), which correlated with the reduced expression of target viral genes and respective viral proteins. Therefore, retrovirus‐mediated delivery of siRNA for gene silencing can be used to study the specific functions of viral genes associated with replication and may have potential therapeutic applications.

"Purpose: To evaluate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of femoral head avascular necrosis (AVN) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Materials and Methods: Seventy‐nine SARS patients with hip pain underwent both conventional and diffusion‐weighted MRI (b‐value = 0–1000 seconds/mm2). The abnormal regions on the diffusion‐weighted images were outlined by using the conventional images as guides, and the ADCs were calculated. The ADC differences between normal and AVN femoral heads were compared. Results: Of the 158 hips examined, 28 had AVN (11 with bilateral hip AVN, three with right hip AVN, and three with left hip AVN). The mean ADC was markedly greater in the AVN femoral head (1.66 × 10–3 mm2/second ± 0.20) than in the normal femoral head (0.47 × 10–3 mm2/second ± 0.082; P < 0.0001). There was no overlap between the normal and AVN femoral heads.

"Objectives: To determine the clinical presentation, findings, and outcomes of older adults (> 60) with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and compare these with a control group of younger patients (≤60). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: A community‐based, acute hospital in Hong Kong. Participants: All adult inpatients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS. Measurements: Clinical presentations, investigations, treatment, and 30‐ and 150‐day mortality. Results: There were 52 young and 25 older patients with a mean age±standard deviation of 39.5±11.7 and 72.1±7.2, respectively. Fever, chills, and diarrhea were more common in younger patients, whereas decrease in appetite and general condition occurred only in older patients. The prevalence of positive reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in nasopharyngeal secretions and stool samples was similar in the two groups. The prevalence of positive serological tests for SARS‐CoV was significantly lower in older patients (42% vs 92%, P<.001). This was largely due to incomplete testing in elderly patients. Older patients were more likely to develop secondary nosocomial infection, be admitted to an intensive care unit, and require mechanical ventilation. The cumulative 30‐ and 150‐day mortality rates were 3.8% and 7.6%, respectively, in young patients with SARS and 56% and 60%, respectively, in older patients (P<.001). Conclusion: Older patients with SARS more often presented with nonspecific symptoms, and the prognosis was poor. Reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was useful in diagnosing SARS in older patients, but the role of serological tests in individual elderly is limited.","gerontology"
"The etiologic role of recently identified respiratory viruses for acute wheezing in children is not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of recently identified viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV‐NL63), and human coronavirus HKU1 (hCoV‐HKU1) in children with acute wheezing. Viral etiology was identified in 231 children hospitalized with acute wheezing, aged from 1 month to 5 years. Viral antigens for common respiratory viruses were detected by IFA or multiplex PCR. RT‐PCR was used to detect respiratory rhinoviruses, hCoV‐NL63, hCoV‐HKU1, and hMPV. PCR assays for hBoV DNA were performed using the primer sets for noncapsid protein (NP1) and nonstructural protein (NS1) genes. Viruses were found in 61.5% (142/231) of the study population and a single virus was detected in 45.5% (105/231) of the study population. Rhinovirus (33.3%), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV; 13.8%), and hBoV (13.8%) were the most frequently detected viruses. hMPV and hCoV‐NL63 were detected in 7.8% and 1.3% of wheezing children, respectively. HCoV‐HKU1 was not detected. In 16.0% of the study population, more than one virus was detected. In children with acute wheezing, rhinovirus, hRSV, and hBoV were most frequently detected.

"Characterisation of new viruses is often hindered by difficulties in amplifying them in cell culture, limited antigenic/serological cross‐reactivity or the lack of nucleic acid hybridisation to known viral sequences. Numerous molecular methods have been used to genetically characterise new viruses without prior in vitro replication or the use of virus‐specific reagents. In the recent metagenomic studies viral particles from uncultured environmental and clinical samples have been purified and their nucleic acids randomly amplified prior to subcloning and sequencing. Already known and novel viruses were then identified by comparing their translated sequence to those of viral proteins in public sequence databases. Metagenomic approaches to viral characterisation have been applied to seawater, near shore sediments, faeces, serum, plasma and respiratory secretions and have broadened the range of known viral diversity. Selection of samples with high viral loads, purification of viral particles, removal of cellular nucleic acids, efficient sequence‐independent amplification of viral RNA and DNA, recognisable sequence similarities to known viral sequences and deep sampling of the nucleic acid populations through large scale sequencing can all improve the yield of new viruses. This review lists some of the animal viruses recently identified using sequence‐independent methods, current laboratory and bioinformatics methods, together with their limitations and potential improvements. Viral metagenomic approaches provide novel opportunities to generate an unbiased characterisation of the viral populations in various organisms and environments.

"A new method was developed for detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) by loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which was compared with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and real‐time PCR for specificity and sensitivity. All initial validation studies with the control DNA proved to be type‐specific. In order to evaluate the reliability of HPV type‐specific LAMP detecting HPV DNA from clinical samples, tissue specimens were obtained from 27 patients with external genital polypoid lesions. The histologic diagnoses included condyloma acuminatum (n = 21), bowenoid papulosis (n = 2), seborrheic keratosis (n = 2), epidermolytic acanthoma (n = 1), and hairy nymphae (n = 1). HPV‐6 DNA and HPV‐11 DNA were detected in 18 and 3 of 21 condylomata acuminata, respectively, and there was no simultaneous infection. HPV‐16 DNA was detected in one of two bowenoid papuloses. HPV DNA was not detected in the seborrheic keratoses, epidermolytic acanthoma, and hairy nymphae. These results correlated perfectly with those from real‐time PCR analysis. Most positive samples contained high copy numbers of HPV DNA. HPV‐11 DNA was detected in one case that could not be detected by PCR. The average reaction time was about 59 min. There was a linear correlation between the genome quantity and reaction time to reach the threshold. The LAMP method has an additional advantage as a quantitative method, and is superior in terms of sensitivity, specificity, rapidity, and simplicity, and can potentially be a valuable tool for the detection of HPV DNA.

"Emerging infectious diseases are of international concern because of the potential for, and impact of, pandemics; however, they are difficult to predict. To identify the drivers of disease emergence, we analyzed infectious disease threat events (IDTEs) detected through epidemic intelligence collected at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) between 2008 and 2013, and compared the observed results with a 2008 ECDC foresight study of projected drivers of future IDTEs in Europe. Among 10 categories of IDTEs, foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were the most common, vaccine‐preventable IDTEs caused the highest number of cases, and airborne IDTEs caused the most deaths. Observed drivers for each IDTE were sorted into three main groups: globalization and environmental drivers contributed to 61% of all IDTEs, public health system drivers contributed to 21%, and social and demographic drivers to 18%. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that four of the top five drivers for observed IDTEs were in the globalization and environment group. In the observational study, the globalization and environment group was related to all IDTE categories, but only to five of eight categories in the foresight study. Directly targeting these drivers with public health interventions may diminish the chances of IDTE occurrence from the outset.","multidisciplinary"
"Infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and avian influenza virus (AIV) H9 subtype are major pathogens of chickens causing serious respiratory tract disease and heavy economic losses. To better understand the replication features of these viruses in their target organs and molecular pathogenesis of these different viruses, comparative proteomic analysis was performed to investigate the proteome changes of primary target organ during IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 infections, using 2D‐DIGE followed MALDI‐TOF/TOF‐MS. In total, 44, 39, 41, 48, and 38 proteins were identified in the tracheal tissues of the chickens inoculated with IBV (ck/CH/LDL/97I, H120), NDV (La Sota), and AIV H9, and between ck/CH/LDL/97I and H120, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis showed that IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 induced similar core host responses involved in biosynthetic, catabolic, metabolic, signal transduction, transport, cytoskeleton organization, macromolecular complex assembly, cell death, response to stress, and immune system process. Comparative analysis of host response induced by different viruses indicated differences in protein expression changes induced by IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 may be responsible for the specific pathogenesis of these different viruses. Our result reveals specific host response to IBV, NDV, and AIVH9 infections and provides insights into the distinct pathogenic mechanisms of these avian respiratory viruses.","biochemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein fusion core consists of a six‐helix bundle with the three C‐terminal heptad repeat (HR2) helices packed against a central coiled‐coil of the other three N‐terminal heptad repeat (HR1) helices. Each of the three peripheral HR2 helices shows prominent contacts with the hydrophobic surface of the central HR1 coiled‐coil. The concerted protein–protein interactions among the HR helices are responsible for the fusion event that leads to the release of the SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid into the target host‐cell. In this investigation, we applied recombinant protein and synthetic peptide‐based biophysical assays to characterize the biological activities of the HR helices. In a parallel experiment, we employed a HIV‐luc/SARS pseudotyped virus entry inhibition assay to screen for potent inhibitory activities on HR peptides derived from the SARS‐CoV S protein HR regions and a series of other small‐molecule drugs. Three HR peptides and five small‐molecule drugs were identified as potential inhibitors. ADS‐J1, which has been used to interfere with the fusogenesis of HIV‐1 onto CD4+ cells, demonstrated the highest HIV‐luc/SARS pseudotyped virus‐entry inhibition activity among the other small‐molecule drugs. Molecular modeling analysis suggested that ADS‐J1 may bind to the deep pocket of the hydrophobic groove on the surface of the central coiled‐coil of SARS‐CoV S HR protein and prevent the entrance of the SARS‐CoV into the host cells.

"1 Avian influenza (AI) viruses primarily circulate in wild waterfowl populations and are occasionally transmitted to domestic poultry flocks. However, the possible roles of other wildlife species, such as wild mammals, in AI virus ecology have not been adequately addressed. 2 Due to their habitat and behaviour, many wild mammals may be capable of transmitting pathogens among wild and domestic populations. Exposure to AI viruses has been reported in an array of wild and domestic animals. The presence of wild mammals on farms has been identified as a risk factor for at least one poultry AI outbreak in North America. These reports suggest the need for seroprevalence studies examining the exposure of wild mammals to AI viruses. 3 Serological tests are routinely used to assess domestic poultry, domestic swine and human exposure to influenza A viruses, but these tests have not been validated for use in wild mammals. As such, some of these protocols may require adjustments or may be inappropriate for use in serology testing of wild mammals. Herein, we review these serological techniques and evaluate their potential usefulness in AI surveillance of wild mammals. We call for care to be taken when applying serological tests outside their original area of validation, and for continued assay verification for multiple species and virus strains.","zoology"
"Abstract This study examined anxiety and coping responses to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. Trait anxiety, situation‐specific coping strategies, and coping flexibility were proposed as predictors of state anxiety during the early phase of the SARS epidemic. Seven‐two Hong Kong undergraduates (31 men, 41 women) participated in a prospective, multiple time‐point study. Participants' trait anxiety and coping flexibility had been assessed in an earlier study. Five months later, they reported their anxiety and coping at each of the four time points during the outbreak. Results revealed fluctuations in state anxiety across time points. Results from hierarchical linear modeling showed that trait anxiety as well as the situation‐appropriate coping strategies of avoidance and personal hygiene practice accounted for changes in state anxiety.","psychology"
"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) encodes 15 nonstructural proteins (nsps) which play crucial roles in RNA transcription and genome replication. One of them, nsp3, contains an ADRP (adenosine diphosphate‐ribose‐1′‐phosphatase) domain which was revealed in recent studies to have ADP‐ribose‐1′‐monophosphatase (Appr‐1′‐pase) activity. Appr‐1′‐pase catalyzes the conversion of ADP‐ribose‐1′‐monophosphate (Appr‐1′‐p) to ADP‐ribose in the tRNA‐splicing pathway. The gene segment encoding the IBV nsp3 ADRP domain has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein has been crystallized and the crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution. They belonged to space group P1, with unit‐cell parameters a = 41.1, b = 43.2, c = 48.9 Å, α = 78.0, β = 80.0, γ = 73.6°. Each asymmetric unit contains two molecules.","crystallography"
"The mode of binding of oligosaccharides to griffithsin, an antiviral lectin from the red alga Griffithsia sp., was investigated by a combination of X‐ray crystallography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and molecular modeling. The structures of complexes of griffithsin with 1→6α‐mannobiose and with maltose were solved and refined at the resolution of 2.0 and 1.5 Å, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters of binding of 1→6α‐mannobiose, maltose, and mannose to griffithsin were determined. Binding profiles of 1→6α‐mannobiose and mannose were similar with Kd values of 83.3 μM and 102 μM, respectively. The binding of maltose to griffithsin was significantly weaker, with a fourfold lower affinity (Kd = 394 μM). In all cases the binding at 30°C was entropically rather than enthalpically driven. On the basis of the experimental crystal structures, as well as on previously determined structures of complexes with monosaccharides, it was possible to create a model of a tridentate complex of griffithsin with Man9GlcNAc2, a high mannose oligosaccharide commonly found on the surface of viral glycoproteins. All shorter oligomannoses could be modeled only as bidentate or monodentate complexes with griffithsin. The ability to mediate tight multivalent and multisite interactions with high‐mannose oligosaccharides helps to explain the potent antiviral activity of griffithsin.

"Functional protein microarrays are emerging as a promising new tool for large‐scale and high‐throughput studies. In this article, we review their applications in basic proteomics research, where various types of assays have been developed to probe binding activities to other biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules, and glycans. We also report recent progress of using functional protein microarrays in profiling protein post‐translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and nitrosylation. Finally, we discuss potential of functional protein microarrays in biomarker identification and clinical diagnostics. We strongly believe that functional protein microarrays will soon become an indispensible and invaluable tool in proteomics research and systems biology.

"As an approach to determining the aetiology of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), we searched for a virus expressed in human CLL B‐cells by combining high‐throughput sequencing and digital subtraction. Pooled B‐cell mRNA transcriptomes from five CLL patients and five healthy donors were sequenced with 454 Life Sciences technology. Human reads were excluded by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and BLAT (BLAST‐like alignment tool) searches. Remaining reads were screened with BLAST against viral databases. Purified B‐cells from two CLL patients, with and without stimulation by phorbol‐esters, were sequenced using Illumina technology to achieve depth of sequencing. Burrows‐Wheeler Aligner mapping and BLAST searches were used for the Illumina data. Pyrosequencing resulted in about 400 000 reads per sample. No viral candidate could be found. Illumina single‐end sequencing for 115 cycles yielded an average of 26 ± 2·5 million filtered reads per sample, of which 2·2 ± 0·6 million remained unmapped to human references. BLAST searches of these reads against viral and human databases assigned nine reads to an Epstein‐Barr virus origin, in one sample following phorbol‐ester stimulation. Other reads showing a putative viral origin were dismissed after further analysis. Despite an in‐depth analysis of the CLL transcriptome reaching more than 100 million sequences, we have not found evidence for a putative viral candidate in CLL.","hematology"
"Mass spectrometry (MS) has become an important technique to identify microbial biomarkers. The rapid and accurate MS identification of microorganisms without any extensive pretreatment of samples is now possible. This review summarizes MS methods that are currently utilized in microbial analyses. Affinity methods are effective to clean, enrich, and investigate microorganisms from complex matrices. Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles might concentrate traces of target microorganisms from sample solutions. Therefore, nanoparticle‐based techniques have a favorable detection limit. MS coupled with various chromatographic techniques, such as liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, reduces the complexity of microbial biomarkers and yields reliable results. The direct analysis of whole pathogenic microbial cells with matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization MS without sample separation reveals specific biomarkers for taxonomy, and has the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, and high‐throughput measurements. The MS detection of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐amplified microbial nucleic acids provides an alternative to biomarker analysis. This review will conclude with some current applications of MS in the identification of pathogens. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1203–1224, 2011","spectroscopy"
"Summary.  Plasma‐derived factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand Factor (VWF)/FVIII concentrates have been successfully used to treat haemophilia since the late 1960s. These products are derived from pools of plasma donations that may contain viral contaminants – including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) – and may therefore present a transmission risk to recipients. To ensure the safety of Haemate® P/Humate‐P®, a plasma‐derived VWF/FVIII concentrate, donors of plasma are carefully selected and all donations are screened for viral antigens (HBV), virus‐specific antibodies (HIV‐1/2, HCV) and genomic material [hepatitis A virus, HBV, HCV, HIV‐1 and high titres of human parvovirus B19 (B19V)]. As a quality control measure, plasma pools for fractionation are only released for further processing when non‐reactivity has been demonstrated in serological and genome amplification assays. The manufacturing process for plasma‐derived products, especially the fundamental procedure of pasteurization, is effective in inactivating and/or removing a wide variety of viruses that may potentially be present despite the screening process. This has been demonstrated in virus validation studies using a range of different viruses. New emerging infectious agents, including prions, which potentially pose a threat to recipients of plasma derivatives, are also the subject of safety evaluations. The multiple precautionary measures that are inherent in the overall production process of Haemate P/Humate‐P have resulted in an excellent safety record, documented during 25 years of clinical use, and will help to maintain the high safety margin in the future.","hematology"
"Elucidation of the energetic principles of binding affinity and specificity is a central task in many branches of current sciences: biology, medicine, pharmacology, chemistry, material sciences, etc. In biomedical research, integral approaches combining structural information with in‐solution biophysical data have proved to be a powerful way toward understanding the physical basis of vital cellular phenomena. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a valuable experimental tool facilitating quantification of the thermodynamic parameters that characterize recognition processes involving biomacromolecules. The method provides access to all relevant thermodynamic information by performing a few experiments. In particular, ITC experiments allow to by‐pass tedious and (rarely precise) procedures aimed at determining the changes in enthalpy and entropy upon binding by van't Hoff analysis. Notwithstanding limitations, ITC has now the reputation of being the “gold standard” and ITC data are widely used to validate theoretical predictions of thermodynamic parameters, as well as to benchmark the results of novel binding assays. In this paper, we discuss several publications from 2007 reporting ITC results. The focus is on applications in biologically oriented fields. We do not intend a comprehensive coverage of all newly accumulated information. Rather, we emphasize work which has captured our attention with originality and far‐reaching analysis, or else has provided ideas for expanding the potential of the method.

"Summary.  Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates have revolutionized the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. Concerns over the transmission of viral infections through these products have been addressed through stringent, donor‐screening procedures and robust antiviral manufacturing steps. Bio Products Laboratory has developed a high‐purity FVIII product with von Willebrand factor, Optivate®. Its safety, tolerability and efficacy as prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds have been established in long‐term studies. Seventy previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A, with ≥20 exposure days, were recruited into two long‐term, multicentre, open‐label studies. The protocols were virtually identical. Patients received Optivate® either prophylactically or on‐demand. A mean of 159.0 EDs were experienced over 11 320 infusions. Under both conditions, Optivate® was well tolerated. Only 10% of patients experienced a treatment‐related adverse event; the most commonly reported were headache (4% of patients) and dizziness (3% of patients). The mean number of bleeds/patient over the 2 year treatment period was 23.5 during prophylactic use and 70.4 during on‐demand use. In patients treated prophylactically, clinical responses to breakthrough bleeds were rated by physicians as excellent or good and as very helpful or helpful by patients in 95% of bleeds. Clinical responses for on‐demand patients were rated as excellent or good by physicians and helpful or very helpful by the patients for 91% of bleeds. There were no viral transmissions or inhibitors. The studies confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of Optivate® in both prophylactic and on‐demand management of patients with haemophilia A.","hematology"
"Aims: The aim of this project was to validate a method to deliver a reproducible, selected dose of infective bioaerosol through a respiratory protective technology to an animal that exhibits a proportional clinical response. Methods and Results: The Controlled Aerosol Test System (CATS) was designed to generate and condition a viable infective aerosol, pass it through a treatment technology and thence to the breathing zone of a mouse constrained in a Nose‐Only Inhalation Exposure System (NOIES). A scanning mobility particle sizer and impingers at sampling ports were used to show that viability is preserved and particle size distribution (PSD) is acceptably uniform throughout the open CATS, including the 12 ports of the NOIES, and that a particle filter used caused the expected attenuation of particle counts. Conclusions: Controlled Aerosol Test System delivers uniformly to mice constrained in the NOIES a selectable dose of viral bioaerosol whose PSD and viable counts remain consistent for an hour. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study's characterization of CATS provides a new test system in which a susceptible small‐animal model can be used as the detector in a quantitative method to evaluate the ability of respiratory protective technologies to attenuate the infectivity of an inspired pathogenic aerosol. This provides a major improvement over the use of viable bioaerosol collectors (e.g. impactors and impingers), which provide data that are difficult to relate to the attenuation of pathogenicity.","microbiology"

"Background and objective:  The temporal importance of prognostic indicators for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has not been studied. This study identified the various clinical prognostic factors for SARS and described the temporal evolution of these factors in the course of the SARS illness in Hong Kong in 2003. Methods:  A retrospective analysis of the entire Hong Kong cohort of 1312 laboratory‐confirmed SARS patients aged 15–74 years was undertaken. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at presentation and investigative data during the first 10 days of illness from the time of symptom onset were compiled. Two adverse outcomes were examined: hospital mortality and the development of oxygenation failure based on the estimated PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <200 mm Hg. Logistic regression was used to identify the association between these prognostic factors and outcomes. Results:  Based on adjusted odds ratios with a P‐value of <0.05, older age, male gender, elevated pulse rate and elevated neutrophil count were all predictive of oxygenation failure and death during the 10‐day illness. Raised serum albumin and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were predictive of hospital mortality during this period. The presenting ALT and CPK level and the day 7 and day 10 platelet counts were predictive of oxygenation failure while the day 7 LDH was predictive of death. Contact exposure outside health‐care institutions also appeared to carry higher risk of death. Conclusion:  This large‐scale analysis identified important discriminatory parameters related to the patients’ demographic profile (age and gender), severity of illness (pulse rate and neutrophil count), and multisystem derangement (platelet count, CPK, ALT and LDH), all of which prognosticated adverse outcomes during the SARS episode. While age, pulse rate and neutrophil count consistently remained significant prognosticators during the first 10 days of illness, the prognostic impact of other derangements was more time‐course dependent. Clinicians should be aware of the time‐course evolution of these prognosticators.","respiratory"
"Recent events have led to a revision in ED equipment, preparedness and training for disasters. However, clinicians must still decide when, and what level of personal protection is required when a toxic threat exists. If possible, clear, simple and achievable protocols are required in such situations. Following an off‐site Australasian chemical biological or radiological incident, current evidence indicates that the initial receiving ED staff will be adequately protected from all known chemical biological and radiological inhalational threats by wearing a properly fitted P2 (N95) mask, or its equivalent. Protection from serious contact injury is offered by wearing double gloves, disposable fluid‐repellent coveralls or gown, eye protection, surgical mask, and ideally, a cap and shoe covers; in conjunction with universal precautions and procedures.","emergency"
"The masked palm civet is distributed through south‐east Asia, China and the Himalayas. Because of its potential role in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, it has become important to gather information on this species, and notably to provide a tool to determine the origin of farm and market animals. For this purpose, we studied the genetic variability and the phylogeographic pattern of the masked palm civet Paguma larvata. First, two portions of mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and the control region, were sequenced for a total of 76 individuals sampled from China, the Indochinese region and the Sundaic region. Results indicated a low genetic variability and suggested a lack of a phylogeographic structure in this species, which do not allow inferring the geographic origin of samples of unknown origin, although it is possible to distinguish individuals from China and the Sundaic region. This low variation is in contrast to the well‐marked morphological differentiation between the populations in the Sundaic and Chinese–Indochinese regions. We also used five microsatellite loci to genotype 149 samples from two wild and four farmed populations in China, where the masked palm civet is farmed and where the SARS coronavirus was isolated. These analyses also showed a reduced variability in Chinese civets and showed that farmed populations did not exhibit a lower genetic diversity than wild populations, suggesting frequent introductions of wild individuals into farms.","zoology"
"RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism displayed by most eukaryotic cells to rid themselves of foreign double‐stranded RNA molecules. RNAi has now been demonstrated to function in mammalian cells to alter gene expression, and has been used as a means for genetic discovery as well as a possible strategy for genetic correction. RNAi was first described in animal cells by Fire and colleagues in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Knowledge of RNAi mechanism in mammalian cell in 2001 brought a storm in the field of drug discovery. During the past few years scientists all over the world are focusing on exploiting the therapeutic potential of RNAi for identifying a new class of therapeutics. The applications of RNAi in medicine are unlimited because all cells possess RNAi machinery and hence all genes can be potential targets for therapy. RNAi can be developed as an endogenous host defense mechanism against many infections and diseases. Several studies have demonstrated therapeutic benefits of small interfering RNAs and micro RNAs in animal models. This has led to the rapid advancement of the technique from research discovery to clinical trials.","biotechnology"
"Asia is a highly heterogeneous region with vastly different cultures, social constitutions and populations affected by a wide spectrum of respiratory diseases caused by tropical pathogens. Asian patients with community‐acquired pneumonia differ from their Western counterparts in microbiological aetiology, in particular the prominence of Gram‐negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the differences in socioeconomic and health‐care infrastructures limit the usefulness of Western management guidelines for pneumonia in Asia. The importance of emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza infection remain as close concerns for practising respirologists in Asia. Specific infections such as melioidosis, dengue haemorrhagic fever, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, penicilliosis marneffei, malaria, amoebiasis, paragonimiasis, strongyloidiasis, gnathostomiasis, trinchinellosis, schistosomiasis and echinococcosis occur commonly in Asia and manifest with a prominent respiratory component. Pulmonary eosinophilia, endemic in parts of Asia, could occur with a wide range of tropical infections. Tropical eosinophilia is believed to be a hyper‐sensitivity reaction to degenerating microfilariae trapped in the lungs. This article attempts to address the key respiratory issues in these respiratory infections unique to Asia and highlight the important diagnostic and management issues faced by practising respirologists.","respiratory"

"Antiviral therapy and vaccination are important strategies for the control of human influenza/H5N1 disease, but the efficacy of these modalities is limited by timing of administration and shortage of supply. Lung protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and low pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating patients with ARDS. Low‐dose steroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may play a limited supportive role for early ARDS/acute lung injury, but it is contra‐indicated in critically ill patients with multi‐organ failure and haemodynamic instability. NPPV and oxygen therapy should be applied in healthcare facilities with good ventilation and respiratory protection as substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5 m and 0.4 m radius of patients receiving NPPV and oxygen via a simple mask, respectively. Intravenous gammaglobulin should be used with caution for treatment of reactive haemo‐phagocytosis due to its thrombogenic effects, whereas the role of etoposide needs evaluation with animal models. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma may be useful as rescue therapy. More data are needed to explore the potential role of other drugs with immuno‐modulating properties such as statins. Healthcare workers currently must apply strict standards, contact and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected cases, and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol‐generating procedures. Non‐pharmacological measures such as early case isolation, household quarantine, school/workplace closure, good community hygiene and restrictions on travel are useful measures in controlling a pandemic.","respiratory"
"We examined the radiological and pulmonary function outcomes of children affected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at 6 months from diagnosis. Twenty‐one female and 26 male Chinese patients (median age, 13.6 years; interquartile range, 9.9–16.0) were studied. In each subject, high‐resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax and pulmonary function were assessed. All children were asymptomatic and had a normal clinical examination. Mild pulmonary abnormalities were detected on HRCT in 16 (34.0%) subjects, including residual ground‐glass opacification (n = 5), air trapping (n = 8), and a combination of ground‐glass changes and air trapping (n = 3). The need for oxygen supplementation (P = 0.02) and lymphopenia during the course of illness (P = 0.012) were significant risk factors in predicting abnormal HRCT. There were no significant lung function differences between those with and without HRCT abnormalities. Despite complete clinical resolution, a considerable proportion of children affected with SARS had abnormal HRCT findings at 6 months. These abnormalities were more prevalent in those with severe disease. It is important that careful follow‐up be carried out to assess the clinical significance and persistence of such abnormalities.

"Despite being the most significant arboviral disease worldwide, dengue has no antiviral treatment or reliable severity predictors. It has been shown that apoptotic cells from blood and tissues may be involved in the complex pathogenesis of dengue. However, very little is known about the interplay between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mediators in this disease. Therefore, plasma levels of the three proapoptotic mediators Fas ligand (FasL), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), and TNF‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand (TRAIL) were measured in dengue patients. Patients were classified according to the World Health Organization classification of dengue revised in 2009. Additionally, inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs) were determined in plasma (Survivin) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) lysates (cIAP‐1, cIAP‐2, XIAP). Levels of apoptotic proteins in plasma were correlated with counts of blood cells. FasL and TRAIL levels were elevated in dengue patients without warning signs when compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. Dengue patients with warning signs showed decreased levels of Survivin compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. TRAIL was inversely correlated with counts of lymphocyte subsets. In contrast, Survivin was positively correlated with leukocyte counts. There was a trend of elevated IAPs levels in PBMCs of patients with severe dengue. The results suggest a likely antiviral effect of TRAIL in dengue. It appears that TRAIL might be involved with apoptosis induction of lymphocytes, whereas IAPs might participate in protecting leukocytes from apoptosis. Further research is needed to explore the interactions between pro and antiapoptotic molecules and their implications in dengue pathogenesis. J. Med.

"Though agriculture is often viewed as one of humanity's crowning achievements, skeletal evidence indicates that dependence on domesticated plants and animals was accompanied by an increase in infectious disease. Scientists have proposed that many important infections emerged in the period following the advent of agriculture, as a result of newly dense populations and novel proximity to domestic animals that served as reservoirs for novel pathogens. Here, we review genomic evidence regarding pathogen origins, analyzing these data using the epidemiological transition framework. Genetic information has forced us to reconsider how and when many important pathogens emerged; it appears that a number of infections thought to result from contact with domesticated animals arose much earlier than agriculture was adopted. We also consider the broader effect of agriculture upon the microbiome, exploring potential consequences for human health.

"Two tests were developed that allow the detection and genotyping of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and other closely related gammacoronaviruses. The first test employs a one‐step, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay in which the amplification is monitored in real time using a TaqMan® probe. This real‐time RT‐PCR test was used to examine a panel of field samples and its performance compared to virus isolation in embryonated fowls’ eggs. A total of 323 field samples were tested; 176 samples were positive using the real‐time RT‐PCR method, but only three were positive by virus isolation. Sequencing was used to confirm the positive real‐time RT‐PCR results for a subset of samples. The test is suitable for swabs and post‐mortem samples and has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific. The second test, a genotyping method, was developed for identification of the strain of IBV present in field samples based on nucleotide variations within the gene encoding the S1 subunit of the surface spike (S) glycoprotein. This method was developed to provide a tool to inform vaccination decisions and for ongoing surveillance to detect new and emerging strains of IBV within the UK. The performance of the test was evaluated using laboratory isolates of IBV and field samples. Both tests are suitable for use in a high‐throughput diagnostic laboratory.","veterinary"
"Recently, a dengue virus‐induced apoptosis p53‐ and mitochondria‐mediated were reported in human and animal cells. To understand further the underlying mechanisms, a p53‐deficient cell line, H1299, and a p53‐knockin cell line, H273, were infected with dengue type 1 virus and the cellular gene expression profiles at the mRNA level were analyzed by affymetrix array analysis. The results showed 183 genes with at least twofold increase at mRNA expression level in dengue virus‐infected cells. Among the 183 genes, 68 genes were up‐regulated in both H1299 and H273 cells and 78 genes were found to be up‐regulated in only H273 cells. Eleven selected genes, mainly involved in IFN‐pathway, cell cycle, signal transduction, and ubiquitin–proteasome pathways were confirmed using qualitative and quantitative PCR. Interestingly, an approximately 32‐fold increase in caspase‐1 expression was observed in the p53‐knockin cell line, H273. Gene silencing of caspase‐1 or inhibition of caspase‐1 activity led to reduction in dengue virus‐induced apoptosis with minimal effect on virus replication. J. Med.

"Limited amount of information is available in Taiwan on the genetic or antigenic characteristics of influenza A virus prior to the establishment of a Taiwan surveillance network in 2000. Isolates of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in Taiwan between 1980 and 2006 were studied, and part of the hemagglutinin gene was analyzed due to its importance in terms of viral infection and antibody neutralization. Results from a phylogenetic analysis indicate continuous evolutionary topology in H3N2 isolates, and two distinct H1N1 lineages. Many genetic relationships between vaccine strains and epidemic isolates appearing in Taiwan before other global locations were also observed and recorded in addition to a gradual increase in the number of N‐linked glycosylation sites on partial HA1 proteins since 1980. The results from pairwise comparisons of HA1 nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences indicate shared identities within groups organized according to their bootstrap and P‐values of approximately 95.5–100% and 95.7–100% in H1N1 and 94.5–100% and 93.2–100% in H3N2 viruses, respectively. Comparisons of amino acid substitutions in the five antigenic regions reveal highly non‐synonymous changes occurring in the Sb region of H1N1 and in the B region of H3N2. The results of an antigenic analysis using a hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test indicate the presence of some epidemic strains 1–2 years earlier in Taiwan than in other parts of the world, as well as higher vaccine mismatch rates. This information supports the need for continuous surveillance of emerging influenza viruses in Taiwan, which will be useful for making global vaccine decisions. J. Med.

"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV‐1) must bind to and enter lymphocytes to replicate and cause the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The association of viral particles with the lymphocyte plasma membrane may vary according to a multitude of unknown variables, including lymphocyte membrane receptor mobilization, lipid raft aggregation, clathrin, caveolin, endosomes, microendosome‐mediated penetration or penetration through a hole in the membrane. The time course of this delivery appears to be short. Fusion of the virion membrane and lymphocyte plasma membrane leads to destabilization of the lymphocyte membrane. Five morphological stages of membrane alteration were observed in the infected lymphocytes: (1) swelling, (2) splitting, (3) fusion, (4) breaking, and (5) thinning of the lipid bilayer. These plasma membrane alterations were not contributed by fixation artifacts, because the dimensions and distance between the subunits of the surface glycoprotein (SU, gp120) and the transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) of the viral particles adjacent to the infected cells and processed at the same time remained unchanged. Destabilization of lipid raft patches in the lymphocyte plasma membrane by unknown variables may facilitate HIV‐1 penetration of lymphocyte, and other cell types. This a combined review of the pertinent literature with our data showing that HIV‐1 may take advantage of multiple penetration approaches simultaneously in the same cell type (H9) to overwhelm the infected cells. The ultrastructural details of H9 cultured cells infected in vitro with HIV‐1 contribute to our understanding of viral particle association with the plasma membrane of infected cells. Microsc. Res.

"Since the proposal of three‐dimensional (3D) domain swapping, many 3D domain‐swapped structures have been reported. However, when compared with the vast protein structure space, it is still unclear whether 3D domain swapping is a general mechanism for protein assembly. Here, we investigated this possibility by constructing a dataset consisting of more than 500 domain‐swapped structures. The domain‐swapped structures were mapped into the protein structure space. We found that about 10% of protein folds and 5% of protein families contain domain‐swapped structures. When comparing the domain‐swapped structures in a family/superfamily, we found that proteins within a family/superfamily can swap in different ways. Interface analysis revealed that the hinge loops contributed more than half of the open interface in 70% of bona fide domain‐swapped dimers, indicating that the hinge loops play an important role in stabilizing the domain‐swapped conformations. Our study supports the suggestion that domain swapping is a general property of all proteins and will facilitate further understanding the mechanism of 3D domain swapping.

"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a prototype of the group III coronaviruses and encodes 15 nonstructural proteins which make up the transcription/replication machinery. The nsp2 protein from IBV has a unique and novel sequence and has no experimentally confirmed function in replication, whereas it has been proposed to be crucial for early viral infection and may inhibit the early host immune response. The gene that encodes a double‐mutant IBV nsp2 N‐terminal domain (residues 9–393 of the polyprotein, with mutations Q132L and L270F) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein was subjected to crystallization trials. The crystals diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution and belonged to space group P62 or P64, with unit‐cell parameters a = b = 114.2, c = 61.0 Å, α = β = 90, γ = 120°.

"We presented a novel way to numerically characterize DNA sequences based on the graphical representation for the sequences comparison and analysis. Instead of calculating the leading eigenvalues of the matrix for graphical representation, we computed curvature and torsion of curves as the descriptor to numerically characterize DNA sequences. The new method was tested on three data sets: the coding sequences of β‐globin gene, all of their exons, and 24 coronavirus geneomes from NCBI. The similarities/dissimilarities and phylogenetic tree of these species verify the validity of our method. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2011","physics"
"Respiratory viruses are well‐known causes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE‐COPD) and also important pathogens for concomitant pneumonia in COPD (CP‐COPD). However, the differences in a viral infection pattern and clinical impacts of respiratory viruses between the two groups have not been well investigated. The clinical and microbiological data from COPD patients admitted with AE‐COPD (n = 281) or CP‐COPD (n = 284) between January 2010 and December 2012 were reviewed. After excluding 88 patients (40 with AE‐COPD and 48 with CP‐COPD) who did not undergo a multiplex RT‐PCR test for respiratory viruses, the demographic characteristics, identified viruses, and clinical outcomes of the AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD groups were compared. Respiratory viruses were identified in 41.9% of AE‐COPD group and 33.5% of the CP‐COPD groups. The most common virus was influenza virus in the AE‐COPD group (33.7%) versus human coronavirus (24.1%) in the CP‐COPD group. Influenza virus was significantly more common in the AE‐ACOPD group than in the CP‐COPD group (P < 0.01). In‐hospital mortality of AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD were 1.2% and 12.3%, respectively (P < 0.01). Among CP‐COPD patients, in‐hospital mortality of patients with only viral infection group, only bacterial infection group, and viral‐bacterial co‐infection were 2.6%, 25.8%, and 17.5%, respectively (P = 0.01). Respiratory viruses were commonly identified in both AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD, influenza virus and human coronavirus were the most common viruses identified in AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD patients, respectively. The mortality rates of only viral infection group was significantly lower than only bacterial infection or viral‐bacterial co‐infection group in CP‐COPD patients. J. Med.

"Nosocomial transmission of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) occurs in children within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). During peak community RSV transmission, three swabs were collected from the nose, hand and personal clothing of visitors and health care workers (HCW) in NICU once every week for eight weeks. Nasal swabs were collected from every third neonate and from any neonate clinically suspected of having a respiratory infection. Environmental sampling of high touch areas was done once during the study period. All swabs were tested for RSV using real time RT‐PCR. There were 173 (519 total) and 109 (327 total) swabs, each of nose, hand and dress from 84 HCWs and 80 visitors respectively and 81 nasal swabs from 55 neonates collected. Thirty five environmental swabs from surfaces of the beds, side tables, counter tops, chairs, tables and computers were collected. Overall 1% of nasal swabs from each of HCWs, visitors and neonates, 4% of dress specimens from visitors and 9% of environmental swabs were positive for RSV‐RNA. The results suggest that though the risk for RSV in the NICU remains low, personnel clothing are contaminated with RSV‐RNA and may have a role in transmission. J. Med.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease with a global impact. Understanding its pathogenesis and developing specific diagnostic methods for its early diagnosis are crucial for the effective management and control of this disease. By using proteomic technology, truncated forms of α1‐antitrypsin (TF‐α1‐AT) were found to increase significantly and consistently in sera of SARS patients compared to control subjects. The result showed a sensitivity of 100% for SARS patients and a specificity of 92.8% for controls. Furthermore, the levels of these proteins significantly correlated with certain clinico‐pathological parameters. The dramatic increase in TF‐α1‐AT may be the result of degradation of α1‐AT. As α1‐AT plays an important role in the protection of lung function, its degradation may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of SARS. These findings indicate that increased TF‐α1‐AT may be therapeutically relevant, and may also be a useful biological marker for the diagnosis of SARS.","biochemistry"
"International adoptions have become increasingly common in the United States. Children awaiting international adoption and families traveling to adopt these children can be exposed to a variety of infectious diseases. Compared with the United States, foreign countries often have different immunization practices and methods of diagnosing, treating, and monitoring disease. Reporting of medical conditions can also differ from that of the United States. The prevalence of infectious diseases varies from country to country and may or may not be common among adopted children. The transmission of tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and measles from adopted children to family members has been documented. Furthermore, infectious organisms (e.g., intestinal parasites), bacterial pathogens (e.g., Bordetella pertussis and Treponema pallidum), and viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis viruses) may cause clinically significant morbidity and mortality among infected children. Diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or avian influenza have not been reported among international adoptees, but transmission is possible if infection is present. Family members may be infected by others during travel or by their adopted child after returning home. Families preparing to adopt a child from abroad should pay special attention to the infectious diseases they may encounter and to the precautions they should take on returning home.","pharmacology"
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by infection with the SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, the development of autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells in patients with SARS at different time periods (the first week: phase I, 1 month after the disease onset: phase II/phase III) were investigated. Antibodies in sera of patients and healthy controls against: (1) A549 human pulmonary epithelial cell‐line, (2) human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC), (3) primary human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEC) were detected by cell‐based ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence staining. The results revealed that serum levels of IgG anti‐A549 cells antibodies, IgG anti‐HUVEC antibodies, and IgM anti‐HPEC antibodies were significantly higher in SARS patients at phase II/phase III than those in healthy controls. Sera from SARS patients at phase II/phase III could mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity against some A549 cells and HPEC. It is concluded that some autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells would be developed after SARS‐CoV infection and this phenomenon may indicate post‐infectious cellular injury and also induce SARS‐induced immunopathology.

"The number and variety of macromolecular structures in complex with `hetero' ligands is growing. The need for rapid delivery of correct geometric parameters for their refinement, which is often crucial for understanding the biological relevance of the structure, is growing correspondingly. The current standard for describing protein structures is the Engh–Huber parameter set. It is an expert data set resulting from selection and analysis of the crystal structures gathered in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Clearly, such a manual approach cannot be applied to the vast and ever‐growing number of chemical compounds. Therefore, a database, named PURY, of geometric parameters of chemical compounds has been developed, together with a server that accesses it. PURY is a compilation of the whole CSD. It contains lists of atom classes and bonds connecting them, as well as angle, chirality, planarity and conformation parameters. The current compilation is based on CSD 5.28 and contains 1978 atom classes and 32 702 bonding, 237 068 angle, 201 860 dihedral and 64 193 improper geometric restraints. Analysis has confirmed that the restraints from the PURY database are suitable for use in macromolecular crystal structure refinement and should be of value to the crystallographic community. The database can be accessed through the web server http://pury.ijs.si/, which creates topology and parameter files from deposited coordinates in suitable forms for the refinement programs MAIN, CNS and REFMAC. In the near future, the server will move to the CSD website http://pury.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/.","crystallography"
"Background.  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality that has had a major impact on health and health care services worldwide. Hong Kong has had a significant number of cases and deaths. Nurses, at the vanguard of the clinical health care team, have been particularly affected by it. The outbreak prompted the health authorities to implement a series of public health measures and hospital policies, including a guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with SARS. Aims and objectives.  This paper aims at providing an overview of what is known about SARS and the impact it has had in Hong Kong and to highlight from the perspective of a school of nursing the major clinical, educational and public health implications. Conclusions.  The lack of understanding and uncertainty about the disease led to significant variation in the provision of information, contributing to the confusion and anxiety in the community. Therefore, there is a need to revise the nursing curriculum, to provide continuing education to all health care professionals, particularly with regard to infection control measures, and to revisit the range of public health policies to ensure the health of the community is protected by these policies. There also has been a reaffirmation of the importance of health promotion that highlights the importance of the partnership between nurses, health policy makers and public health personnel. It is evident that the organization and delivery of clinical practice, teaching and health promotion have to be flexible and responsive to a changing health scenario. Relevance to clinical practice.  Nurses must play a crucial role in the prevention, detection and containment of SARS. They will need to implement and ensure strict adherence to infection control measures and, in some circumstances, isolation and quarantine may be warranted. Attention to the psychological state of patients and family members should not be overlooked. Paramount is education of patients, families and members of the public at large.","nursing"
"The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus spread quickly worldwide in 2009. Since most of the fatal cases were reported in developing countries, rapid and accurate diagnosis methods that are usable in poorly equipped laboratories are necessary. In this study, a mobile detection system for the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus was developed using a reverse‐transcriptase loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (RT‐LAMP) kit with a disposable pocket‐warmer as a heating device (designated as pwRT‐LAMP). The pwRT‐LAMP can detect as few as 100 copies of the virus—which is nearly as sensitive as real‐time reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR)—and does not cross‐react with RNA of seasonal influenza viruses. To evaluate the usefulness of the pwRT‐LAMP system, nasal swab samples were collected from 56 patients with flu‐like symptoms and were tested. Real‐time RT‐PCR confirmed that the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus was present in 27 of the 56 samples. Of these 27 positive samples, QuickVue Influenza A + B immunochromatography detected the virus in only 11 samples (11/27; 40.7%), whereas the pwRT‐LAMP system detected the virus in 26 of the 56 samples (26/27 of the positive samples; 96.3%). These findings indicate that the mobile pwRT‐LAMP system is an accurate diagnostic system for the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus, and has great potential utility in diagnosing future influenza pandemics.

"The codon usage patterns of open reading frames (ORFs) in cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV‐3) have been investigated in this study. The high correlation between GC12% and GC3% suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage and base component in the CyHV‐3, while mutational pressure effect results from the high correlation between GC3% and the first principal axis of principle component analysis (Axis 1) on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value of the viral functional genes. However, the interaction between the absolute codon usage bias and GC3% suggests that other selections take part in the formation of codon usage, except for the mutational pressure. It is noted that the similarity degree of codon usage between the CyHV‐3 and goldfish, Carassius auratus (L.), is higher than that between the virus and common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., suggesting that the goldfish plays a more important role than the common carp in codon usage pattern of the CyHV‐3. The study of codon usage in CyHV‐3 can provide some evidence about the molecular evolution of the virus. It can also enrich our understanding about the relationship between the CyHV‐3 and its hosts by analysing their codon usage patterns.","veterinary"
"ORF 8a is a short 39 amino acid bitopic membrane protein encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome causing corona virus (SARS‐CoV). It has been identified to increase permeability of the lipid membrane for cations. Permeability is suggested to occur due to the assembly of helical bundles. Computational models of a pentameric assembly of 8a peptides are generated using the first 22 amino acids, which include the transmembrane domain. Low energy structures reveal a hydrophilic pore mantled by residues Thr‐8, and −18, Ser‐11, Cys‐13, and Arg‐22. Potential of mean force (PMF) profiles for mono (Na+, K+, Cl−) and divalent (Ca2+) ions along the pore are calculated. The data support experimental findings of a weak cation selectivity of the channel. Calculations on 8a are compared to data derived for a pentameric bundle consisting of the M2 helices of the bacterial pentameric ligand gated ion channel GLIC (3EHZ). PMF curves of both, bundles 8a and M2, show sigmoidal shaped profiles. In comparison to the data for the M2‐GLIC model, data of the 8a bundle show lower amplitude of the PMF values between maximum and minimum and less discrimination amongst ions.

"The nucleoside analogue ribavirin has antiviral activity against many distinct viruses both in vitro and in vivo. Five distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral properties of ribavirin. These include both indirect mechanisms (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibition, immunomodulatory effects) and direct mechanisms (interference with RNA capping, polymerase inhibition, lethal mutagenesis). Recent concerns about bioterrorism have renewed interest in exploring the antiviral activity of ribavirin against unique viruses. In this paper, we review the proposed mechanisms of action with emphasis on recent discoveries, as well as the implications of ribavirin resistance. Evidence exists to support each of the five proposed mechanisms of action, and distinct virus/host combinations may preferentially favour one or more of these mechanisms during antiviral therapy.

"Summary.  Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with chronic inflammation of liver, which leads to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of severe side effects and only a 50–70% cure rate in genotype 1 HCV‐infected patients upon current standard treatment with pegylated interferon‐α plus ribavirin, new therapeutic regimens are still needed. San‐Huang‐Xie‐Xin‐Tang (SHXT) is a transitional Chinese herbal formula, composed of Rhei rhizoma, Scutellaria radix and Coptidis rhizome, and possesses anti‐inflammatory effect. Here, we describe a (+)‐catechin‐containing fraction extracted from SHXT, referred as SHXT‐frC, exhibited effective inhibition of HCV replication, with selectivity index value (SI; CC50/EC50) of 84, and displayed synergistic anti‐HCV effects when combined with interferon‐α, HCV protease inhibitor telaprevir or polymerase inhibitor 2′‐C‐methylcytidine. The activation of factor‐κB (NF‐κB) and cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) signalling pathway has particular relevance to HCV‐associated HCC. SHXT‐frC treatment also caused a concentration‐dependent decrease in the induction of COX‐2 and NF‐κB expression caused by either HCV replication or HCV NS5A protein. Collectively, SHXT‐frC could be an adjuvant treatment for patients with HCV‐induced liver diseases.","virology"
"The pepscan procedure was used to identify betanodavirus B‐cell epitopes recognized by neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and serum samples obtained from sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, naturally infected with betanodavirus. Pepscan was performed with a panel of thirty‐four 12‐mer synthetic peptides that mimicked the entire betanodavirus capsid protein. Sea bass serum samples reacted strongly with three regions of the capsid protein comprising amino acid residues 1–32, 91–162 and 181–212. The latter region was also recognized by neutralizing MAbs and coincided with a region of high antigenic propensity identified by an antigen prediction algorithm. These data suggest that a region of the betanodavirus capsid protein spanning amino acid residues 181–212 may represent a neutralization domain that could potentially be used to inform the development of nodavirus vaccines and immunodiagnostic reagents.","veterinary"
"BACKGROUND: Human plasma–derived products—such as C1 esterase inhibitor (C1‐INH) concentrate, used to treat hereditary angioedema—carry with them the risk of transmitting blood‐borne viruses and, theoretically, prion proteins. To minimize this risk, three complementary approaches are implemented: selection and testing of plasma donations for the absence of pathogenic blood‐borne viruses, similarly testing and releasing the plasma pool for fractionation, and ensuring that the manufacturing process includes validated steps for pathogen inactivation and removal. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This article describes the selection of plasma for the production of C1‐INH and the studies used to confirm the pathogen reduction capacity of the manufacturing process: three independent virus reduction steps—pasteurization, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), and virus filtration—and two prion reduction steps. Samples of product intermediates from the manufacturing steps were spiked with a panel of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and two prion preparations and subjected to a valid scaled‐down version of the respective manufacturing steps resulting in the quantification of the pathogen reduction factors. RESULTS: Validation studies demonstrated overall virus reduction factors for all viruses of more than 15 log, considerably exceeding the potential amount of virus present in a plasma pool for fractionation. Prion proteins were also efficiently removed by the manufacturing process, as currently determined in evaluating the prion removal capacity of the ammonium sulfate precipitation and HIC steps. CONCLUSION: The pathogen reduction capacity demonstrated here indicates that the manufacturing process of the C1‐INH Berinert is highly effective for reducing enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and prion proteins.","hematology"
"SNARE proteins and fusogenic viral membrane proteins represent the major classes of integral membrane proteins that mediate fusion of eukaryotic lipid bilayers. Although both classes have different primary structures, they share a number of basic architectural features. There is ample evidence that the fusogenic function of representative fusion proteins is influenced by the primary structure of the single transmembrane domain (TMD) and the region linking it to the soluble assembly domains. Here, we used comprehensive non‐redundant datasets to examine potential over‐ and underrepresentation of amino acid types in the TMDs and flanking regions relative to control proteins that share similar biosynthetic origins. Our results reveal conserved overall and/or site‐specific enrichment of β‐branched residues and Gly within the TMDs, underrepresentation of Gly and Pro in regions flanking the TMD N‐terminus, and overrepresentation of the same residue types in C‐terminal flanks of SNAREs and viral fusion proteins. Furthermore, the basic Lys and Arg are enriched within SNARE N‐terminal flanking regions. These results suggest evolutionary conservation of key structural features of fusion proteins and are discussed in light of experimental findings that link these features to the fusogenic function of these proteins.

"1 Evidence from the literature, interviews, market surveys, general rapid field surveys and camera trapping was reviewed to infer the regional status of 33 recorded carnivores in South China (Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Hong Kong and Macau). 2 The carnivore fauna in South China is among the most depleted for any continental area in the world. 3 The tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus, grey wolf Canis lupus and binturong Arctictis binturong are probably extirpated. 4 The dhole Cuon alpinus, Asiatic golden cat Catopuma temmincki and clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa are at great risk of regional extirpation, as are the more ecologically adaptable red fox Vulpes vulpes, raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, Asian badger Meles leucurus, Eurasian otter Lutra lutra, Oriental small‐clawed otter Aonyx cinereus and large Indian civet Viverra zibetha. 5 Though more widely reported, the Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus, yellow‐throated marten Martes flavigula, hog badger Arctonyx collaris and Siberian weasel Mustela sibirica are at regional risk. 6 The status of the Burmese ferret‐badger Melogale personata, stripe‐backed weasel Mustela strigidorsa, smooth‐coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, large‐spotted civet Viverra megaspila and Owston's palm civet Chrotogale owstoni is uncertain due to inadequate information. 7 Five carnivore species – the Chinese ferret‐badger Melogale moschata, masked palm civet Paguma larvata, yellow‐bellied weasel Mustela kathiah, small Indian civet Viverricula indica and leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis– are relatively secure (though not common) in the region, along with the Asian palm civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus and the Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus in some areas, while the spotted linsang Prionodon pardicolor and crab‐eating mongoose Herpestes urva may have been under‐reported. 8 The main threats have been habitat destruction and unsustainable exploitation. Only in Hong Kong, where enforcement of protection legislation has been stronger, are the surviving carnivore species easily encountered. 9 Improved enforcement and monitoring are essential to retaining the remainder of South China's carnivores. Support could be boosted by conservation education and better research.","zoology"
"In the context of the recent recalls of contaminated pet food and lead‐painted toys in the United States, we examine patterns of risk perceptions and decisions when facing consumer product‐caused quality risks. Two approaches were used to explore risk perceptions of the product recalls. In the first approach, we elicited judged probabilities and found that people appear to have greatly overestimated the actual risks for both product scenarios. In the second approach, we applied the psychometric paradigm to examine risk perception dimensions concerning these two specific products through factor analysis. There was a similar risk perception pattern for both products: they are seen as unknown risks and are relatively not dread risks. This pattern was also similar to what prior research found for lead paint. Further, we studied people's potential actions to deal with the recalls of these two products. Several factors were found to be significant predictors of respondents’ cautious actions for both product scenarios. Policy considerations regarding product quality risks are discussed. For example, risk communicators could reframe information messages to prompt people to consider total risks packed together from different causes, even when the risk message has been initiated due to a specific recall event.","social"
"There is only limited knowledge on the burden of disease due to both new (HCoV‐NL63 and HKU‐1) and previously discovered coronaviruses (OC43 and 229E) in children.

"Objective: To design and pilot a survey of UK blood donors to assess, on a large scale, their understanding of and compliance with the donor selection guidelines (DSG). Background: Compliance with the DSG is important for maintaining blood safety, however, little is currently known about the extent of this among UK donors. Materials and methods: The online, unlinked survey was based on the donor health check form with a focus on behaviours associated with blood borne infections, sexual contact, drug use and travel. The survey materials were reviewed by a donor focus group and the survey was piloted among 2982 UK donors. Percentage responses were calculated, complaints monitored and answers to questions reviewed. The survey went live in 2013; 225 091 donors were invited via email to participate followed by two reminders. Results: The survey was well received by the focus group, with little concern about the sensitive and personal questions. Their feedback led to important refinement in the survey materials. In the pilots, 21·0% (627/2982) responded, a reminder was necessary to achieve this. Among responders, there was evidence of non‐compliance and test seeking behaviour, and no evidence that intention to donate again was affected. In the live survey, 29% (65 439) responded; responders were generally representative of donors overall. Conclusion: A large scale survey of donor compliances is feasible, acceptable and effective in ascertaining appropriate information; involving donors and the blood services in the development stages through a focus group and pilots was important to achieve this.","hematology"

"A combination of high‐performance affinity chromatography and antisense peptide based combinatorial peptide libraries was used to screen a potential inhibitor for SARS‐CoV. An aromatic‐amino acid‐rich region within the transmembrane domain at the C terminal of spike (S) protein identified as a membrane‐active region was chosen as the target sense peptide (SP) and immobilized as affinity ligand. Four antisense peptides were designed based on the degeneracy of genetic codes. One of them was screened as the lead peptide to construct the extended peptide libraries (EPL). The library screening was carried out at pH 5.5 so as to mimic the low‐pH milieu required by virus fusion. After five cycles of screening, a dodecapeptide KKKKYRNIRRPG (DP) was identified to possess the highest binding affinity to the immobilized sense peptide. The dissociation constant of the complex between the DP and the SP was 5.64 × 10−7 M in a physiological condition. The recognition between the DP and recombinant SARS S protein was demonstrated by ELISA assay to be in a saturable way. The competitive inhibition of the sense peptide in the competitive ELISA reveals the affinity binding between the DP and SARS S protein is specific and directed towards the target SP of the S protein. The results indicate this preferred polypeptide can be used as a lead compound of potent inhibitor of SARS‐CoV. The mechanism study suggests the specific recognition between the DP and the target peptide was due to sequence‐dependent and multi‐modal affinity interaction.

"Acute respiratory infections are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Using multiplex PCR/RT‐PCR methods for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses, the circulation of those viruses during 3 consecutive dry seasons in Cambodia was described. Among 234 patients who presented with influenza‐like illness, 35.5% were positive for at least one virus. Rhinoviruses (43.4%), parainfluenza (31.3%) viruses and coronaviruses (21.7%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus 4 and SARS‐coronavirus were not detected during the study period. Ninety apparently healthy individuals were included as controls and 10% of these samples tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. No significant differences were observed in frequency and in virus copy numbers for rhinovirus detection between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. This study raises questions about the significance of the detection of some respiratory viruses, especially using highly sensitive methods, given their presence in apparently healthy individuals. The link between the presence of the virus and the origin of the illness is therefore unclear. J. Med. Virol. 82:1762–1772, 2010. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) leads to severe injury in the lungs with multiple factors, though the pathogenesis is still largely unclear. This paper describes the particular analyses of the transcriptome of human lung tissue that was infected by SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). Random primers were used to produce ESTs from total RNA samples of the lung tissue. The result showed a high diversity of the transcripts, covering much of the human genome, including loci which do not contain protein coding sequences. 10,801 ESTs were generated and assembled into 267 contigs plus 7,659 singletons. Sequences matching to SARS‐CoV RNAs and other pneumonia‐related microbes were found. The transcripts were well classified by functional annotation. Among the 7,872 assembled sequences that were identified as from human genome, 578 non‐coding genes were revealed by BLAST search. The transcripts were mapped to the human genome with the restriction of identity = 100%, which found a candidate pool of 448 novel transcriptional loci where EST transcriptional signal was never found before. Among these, 13 loci were never reported to be transcriptional by other detection methods such as gene chips, tiling arrays, and paired‐end ditags (PETs). The result showed that random‐priming cDNA library is valid for the investigation of transcript diversity in the virus‐infected tissue.

Viral loads of pandemic H1N1 virus in respiratory specimens, stool, urine, and serum were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Respiratory specimens from patients with seasonal influenza were used as historical controls. Initial pre‐treatment viral load were compared between these two groups. Serial respiratory specimens from patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection were obtained for analysis of viral dynamics. Twenty‐two pandemic H1N1 cases and 44 seasonal influenza historical controls were included. The mean initial viral load before oseltamivir therapy was 1.84 × 108 copies/ml for pandemic H1N1 virus compared with 3.28 × 108 copies/ml in seasonal influenza historical controls (P = 0.085). Among patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection, peak viral load occurred on the day of onset of symptoms, and declined gradually afterwards, with no virus being detectable in respiratory specimens by RT‐PCR 8 days and by culture 5 days after the onset of symptoms respectively, except in one patient. Pandemic H1N1 virus was detected in stool and in urine from 4/9 and 1/14 patients, respectively. Viral culture was also positive from the stool sample with the highest viral load. Younger age was associated with prolonged shedding in the respiratory tract and higher viral load in the stool. Data from this quantitative analysis of viral shedding may have implications for formulating infection control measures. J. Med. Virol. 82:1–7, 2010. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"Abstract More than 300 residents of a private high‐rise housing estate were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome within a short period during the 2003 epidemic in Hong Kong. The outbreak occurred after the identified index patient visited a flat on a middle floor in Block E of the Amoy Gardens estate on two nights. Approximately 45% of the subsequently infected people resided in Block E, while the other 55% of infected cases mainly resided in six other blocks close to Block E. The distribution of the infected flats in Block E conformed to a non‐uniform spatial pattern. Probable environmental causes for airborne transmission associated with the air movements between flats in Block E are identified. The well‐established multi‐zone airflow modeling method was used to analyze the virus‐laden bio‐aerosol dispersion between flats through door and window leakage areas in Block E under six different scenarios. The distribution of infection risk in Block E matched with the virus concentrations in flats predicted with the use of multi‐zone modeling. Our study shows the importance of ventilation design in high‐rise residential apartments.","public"
"Fragment 450–650 of the spike (S) protein (S450–650) of severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) contains epitopes capable of being recognized by convalescent sera of SARS patients. Vaccination of mice with recombinant S450–650 (rS450–650) can induce Abs against SARS‐CoV, although the titer is relatively low. In the present study, a fusion protein linking a fragment (residues 39–272) of murine calreticulin (CRT) to S450–650 in a prokaryotic expression system was created. Compared with target antigen alone, the recombinant fusion product (rS450–650‐CRT) has much improved hydrophilicity and immunogenicity. The S450–650‐specific IgG Abs of BALB/c mice subcutaneously immunized with rS450–650‐CRT were in substantially higher titer (approximately fivefold more). Furthermore, the fusion protein, but not rS450–650 alone, was able to elicit S450–650‐specific IgG responses in T cell deficient nude mice. Given that rCRT/39–272 can drive the maturation of bone‐marrow‐derived dendritic cells, directly activate macrophages and B cells, and also elicit helper T cell responses in vivo, we propose that fragment 39–272 of CRT is an effective molecular adjuvant capable of enhancing target Ag‐specific humoral responses in both a T cell‐dependent and independent manner. Fusion protein rS450–650‐CRT is a potential candidate vaccine against SARS‐CoV infection.","microbiology"
"We previously identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS‐CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS‐CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS‐CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS. SARS‐CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle. These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS‐CoV may also be targets of SARS‐CoV infection. The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS‐CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection. In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS‐CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission. This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways. This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS. Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

"A central mechanistic paradigm of cysteine proteases is that the His–Cys catalytic diad forms an ion‐pair NH(+)/S(−) already in the catalytically active free enzyme. Most molecular modeling studies of cysteine proteases refer to this paradigm as their starting point. Nevertheless, several recent kinetics and X‐ray crystallography studies of viral and bacterial cysteine proteases depart from the ion‐pair mechanism, suggesting general base catalysis. We challenge the postulate of the ion‐pair formation in free papain. Applying our QM/SCRF(VS) molecular modeling approach, we analyzed all protonation states of the catalytic diad in free papain and its SMe derivative, comparing the predicted and experimental pKa data. We conclude that the His–Cys catalytic diad in free papain is fully protonated, NH(+)/SH. The experimental pKa = 8.62 of His159 imidazole in free papain, obtained by NMR‐controlled titration and originally interpreted as the NH(+)/S(−) ⇌ N/S(−) $ {\rm NH}(+)/{\rm S}(-)\rightleftharpoons {\rm N/S}(-) $ equilibrium, is now assigned to the NH(+)/SH ⇌ N/SH$ {\rm NH}(+)/{\rm SH}\rightleftharpoons {\rm N/SH} $ equilibrium.

"Background: Interferon‐α2 (IFNα2) is routinely used for anti‐hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment. However, the therapeutic efficiency is unsatisfactory, particularly in East Asia. Such inefficiency might be a result of the short half‐life, relatively low local concentration and strong side‐effects of interferons. Frequent and repeated injection is also a big burden for patients. In the present study, a single dose of vector‐delivered IFNα1 was tested for its anti‐HBV effects. Methods: Adeno‐associated viral vector (AAV‐IFNα1) was generated to deliver the IFNα1 gene into hepatocytes. IFNα1, hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) and e (HBeAg) antigens were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and/or western blotting. The level of viral DNA was measured by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction. Results: AAV‐IFNα1 effectively transduced HBV‐producing cells (HepAD38) and mouse hepatocytes, where IFNα1 was expressed in a stable manner. Both intracellular and extracellular HBsAg and HBeAg were significantly reduced in vitro. In the HBV‐producing mice, the concentration of IFNα1 in the liver was eight‐fold higher than that in plasma. Compared with control groups, HBeAg/HBsAg antigen levels were reduced by more than ten‐fold from day 1–5, and dropped to an undetectable level on day 9 in the AAV‐IFNα1 group. Concurrently, the level of viral DNA decreased over 30‐fold for several weeks. Conclusions: A single dose administration of AAV‐IFNα1 viral vector displayed prolonged transgene expression and superior antiviral effects both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the use of AAV‐IFNα1 might be a potential alternative strategy for anti‐HBV therapy. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","medicine"

Use of a novel virus detection assay to identify coronavirus HKU1 in the lungs of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient with fatal pneumonia. Transpl Infect Dis 2011. All rights reserved Abstract: A 38‐year‐old female patient with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia for several months following immunodepleting autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. She was treated for influenza, which was isolated repeatedly from oropharynx and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, and later empirically for lupus pneumonitis, but died 6 months after transplant. Autopsy findings failed to show influenza in the lungs or lupus pneumonitis. A novel generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based assay using degenerate primers identified human coronavirus (CoV) HKU1 RNA in BAL fluid at autopsy. CoV was confirmed by virus‐specific PCRs of lung tissue at autopsy. Electron microscopy showed viral particles consistent with CoV HKU1 in lung tissue both at autopsy and from a previous biopsy. Although human CoV HKU1 infection is not usually severe, in highly immunocompromised patients, it can be associated with fatal pneumonia.","transplantation"
"Background and objective:  Viral nucleic acid may be detected for up to 6 months after an acute asthma deterioration, but the pattern and consequences of viral persistence after acute asthma are incompletely understood. This study investigates the frequency of viral persistence after acute asthma, assesses viral infectivity and determines the host inflammatory responses to viral persistence. Methods:  Adults and children presenting to hospital with acute asthma and a confirmed respiratory virus infection were studied acutely and at recovery 4–6 weeks later by clinical evaluation and induced sputum for viral and inflammatory mediator detection. Results:  Viral RNA was detected during both acute asthma and recovery visits in 17 subjects (viral persistence), whereas in 22 subjects viral RNA had cleared by recovery (viral clearance). The following viruses were detected at recovery: human rhinovirus: 16; respiratory syncytial virus: 2; influenza: 2. In subjects with viral persistence, eight isolates were different to the virus detected at Visit 1. Forty‐four per cent of the human rhinovirus isolates were infective at recovery. Asthma and infection severity were similar in the viral clearance and viral persistence groups. Viral persistence was associated with elevated IL‐10 mRNA and inducible protein‐10 gene expression. Conclusions:  Respiratory viral detection after acute asthma is common, and most often persistence is with non‐infective human rhinovirus. There is a host inflammatory response with an altered cytokine environment, and the viral RNA can be source of persistent infection. These effects may have longer‐term consequences in asthma.","respiratory"

"Sialidase catalyzes the removal of a terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates and plays a pivotal role in nutrition, cellular interactions and pathogenesis mediating various infectious diseases including cholera, influenza and sepsis. An array of antiviral sialidase agents have been developed and are commercially available, such as zanamivir and oseltamivir for treating influenza. However, the development of bacterial sialidase inhibitors has been much less successful. Here, natural polyphenolic geranylated flavonoids which show significant inhibitory effects against Cp‐NanI, a sialidase from Clostridium perfringens, are reported. This bacterium causes various gastrointestinal diseases. The crystal structure of the Cp‐NanI catalytic domain in complex with the best inhibitor, diplacone, is also presented. This structure explains how diplacone generates a stable enzyme–inhibitor complex. These results provide a structural framework for understanding the interaction between sialidase and natural flavonoids, which are promising scaffolds on which to discover new anti‐sialidase agents.","crystallography"
"Our previous study reported that co‐administration of honey significantly increased the serum levels of glycyrrhetic acid (GA) after oral administration of glycyrrhizin (GZ) in rabbits. The components of honey are sucrose, glucose, fructose and 5‐hydroxymethyl‐furaldehyde (HMF). To clarify the causative component(s) in honey that altered the metabolic pharmacokinetics of GZ, rabbits were given GZ (150 mg kg−1) with and without glucose (5g/rabbit), fructose (5 g/rabbit) and HMF (1 mg kg−1), respectively, in crossover designs. An HPLC method was used to determine concentrations of GZ and GA in serum as well as GA and 3‐dehydroglycyrrhetic acid (3‐dehydroGA) in faeces suspension. A noncompartment model was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters and analysis of variance was used for statistical comparison. Our results indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of GA was significantly increased by 29% when HMF was coadministered, whereas the pharmacokinetics of GZ and GA were not significantly altered by coadministration of glucose or fructose. An in‐vitro study, using faeces to incubate GZ and GA individually, indicated that HMF significantly inhibited the oxidation of GA to 3‐dehydroGA and this may explain the enhanced GA absorption in‐vivo. It was concluded that HMF is the causative component in honey that affects the presystemic metabolism and pharmacokinetics of GZ in‐vivo.","pharmacology"
"Two major international initiatives – the Convention on Biological Diversity's target to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment – raise the profile of ecological data on the changing state of nature and its implications for human well‐being. This paper is intended to provide a broad overview of current knowledge of these issues. Information on changes in the status of species, size of populations, and extent and condition of habitats is patchy, with little data available for many of the taxa, regions and habitats of greatest importance to the delivery of ecosystem services. However, what we do know strongly suggests that, while exceptions exist, the changes currently underway are for the most part negative, anthropogenic in origin, ominously large and accelerating. The impacts of these changes on human society are idiosyncratic and patchily understood, but for the most part also appear to be negative and substantial. Forecasting future changes is limited by our poor understanding of the cascading impacts of change within communities, of threshold effects, of interactions between the drivers of change, and of linkages between the state of nature and human well‐being. In assessing future science needs, we not only see a strong role for ecological data and theory, but also believe that much closer collaboration with social and earth system scientists is essential if ecology is to have a strong bearing on policy makers.","ecology"
"Background and objective:  Agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are recognized as important causes of community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) worldwide. This study examined the role of these ‘atypical pathogens’ (AP) among adult hospitalized patients with CAP. Methods:  A prospective, observational study of consecutive adult CAP (clinico‐radiological diagnosis) patients hospitalized during 2004–2005 was conducted. Causal organisms were determined using cultures, antigen testing and paired serology. Clinical/laboratory/radiological variables and outcomes were compared between different aetiologies, and a clinical prediction rule for AP was constructed. Results:  There were 1193 patients studied (mean age 70.8 ± 18.0 years, men 59.3%). Causal organisms were identified in 468 (39.2%) patients: ‘bacterial’ (48.7%), ‘viral’ (26.9%), ‘AP’ (28.6%). The AP infections comprised Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila pneumoniae (97.8%) and co‐infection with bacteria/virus (30.6%). The majority of AP infections involved elderly patients (63.4%) with comorbidities (41.8%), and more than one‐third of patients were classified as ‘intermediate’ or ‘high’ risk CAP on presentation (pneumonia severity index IV–V (35.1%); CURB‐65 2–5 (42.5%)). Patients with AP infections had disease severities and outcomes similar to patients with CAP due to other organisms (oxygen therapy 29.1% vs 29.8%; non‐invasive ventilation 3.7% vs 3.3%; admission to the intensive care unit 4.5% vs 2.7%; length of hospitalization 6 day vs 7 day; 30‐day mortality: 2.2% vs 6.0%; overall P > 0.05). Age <65 years, female gender, fever ≥38.0°C, respiratory rate <25/min, pulse rate <100/min, serum sodium >130 mmol/L, leucocyte count <11 × 109/L and Hb < 11 g/dL were features associated with AP infection, but the derived prediction rule failed to reliably discriminate CAP caused by AP from bacterial CAP (area under the curve 0.75). Conclusions:  M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae as single/co‐pathogens are important causes of severe pneumonia among older adults. No reliable clinical indicators exist, so empirical antibiotic coverage for hospitalized CAP patients may need to be considered.","respiratory"
"In (+) RNA coronaviruses, replication and transcription of the giant ∼30 kb genome to produce genome‐ and subgenome‐size RNAs of both polarities are mediated by a cognate membrane‐bound enzymatic complex. Its RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity appears to be supplied by non‐structural protein 12 (nsp12) that includes an RdRp domain conserved in all RNA viruses. Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second RdRp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5′‐(G/U)CC‐3′ trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of <6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C‐terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus RdRps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 RdRp and cellular DNA‐dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 RdRp produces primers utilized by the primer‐dependent nsp12 RdRp.","cell"

"An active micromixer system utilizing the magnetic force was developed and examined for its ability to facilitate the mixing of more than two fluid flows. The mixing performance of the active micromixer was evaluated in aqueous–aqueous systems including dyes for visual observation. A complete analytical microfluidic system was developed by integrating various functional modules into a single chip, thus allowing cell lysis, sample preparation, purification of intracellular molecules, and subsequent analysis. Upon loading the cell samples and lysis solution into the mixing chamber, the integrated microfluidic device allows efficient cell disruption by rotation of a micromagnetic disk and control of mixing time using the Teflon‐coated hydrophobic film as a microvalve. This inflow is followed by separating the cell debris and contaminated proteins from the cell lysate sample using the acrylamide (AAm)‐functionalized SPE. The inflow of partially purified cell lysate sample containing the gold binding polypeptide (GBP)‐fusion protein was bound onto the gold micropatterns by means of its metal binding affinity. The GBP‐fusion method allows immobilization of proteins in bioactive forms onto the gold surface without surface modification suitable for studying antigen–antibody interaction. It was used for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an infectious viral disease, as an example case.","chemistry"

Children appear to be less susceptible to the SARS coronavirus, although the other non‐SARS coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in adults and in children of all ages.

"To understand structural and thermodynamic features of disulfides within an α‐helix, a non‐redundant dataset comprising of 5025 polypeptide chains containing 2311 disulfides was examined. Thirty‐five examples were found of intrahelical disulfides involving a CXXC motif between the N‐Cap and third helical positions. GLY and PRO were the most common amino acids at positions 1 and 2, respectively. The N‐Cap residue for disulfide bonded CXXC motifs had average (ϕ,ψ) values of (−112 ± 25.2°, 106 ± 25.4°). To further explore conformational requirements for intrahelical disulfides, CYS pairs were introduced at positions N‐Cap‐3; 1,4; 7,10 in two helices of an Escherichia coli thioredoxin mutant lacking its active site disulfide (nSS Trx). In both helices, disulfides formed spontaneously during purification only at positions N‐Cap‐3. Mutant stabilities were characterized by chemical denaturation studies (in both oxidized and reduced states) and differential scanning calorimetry (oxidized state only). All oxidized as well as reduced mutants were destabilized relative to nSS Trx. All mutants were redox active, but showed decreased activity relative to wild‐type thioredoxin. Such engineered disulfides can be used to probe helix start sites in proteins of unknown structure and to introduce redox activity into proteins. Conversely, a protein with CYS residues at positions N‐Cap and 3 of an α‐helix is likely to have redox activity. Proteins 2010. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","biophysics"
"Antimicrobial peptides are an essential component of innate immunity and play an important role in host defence against microbial pathogens. They have received increasing attention recently as potential novel pharmaceutical agents. To meet the requirement for necessary basic science studies and clinical trials, large quantities of these peptides are needed. In general, isolation from natural sources and chemical synthesis are not cost‐effective. The relatively low cost and easy scale‐up of the recombinant approach renders it the most attractive means for large‐scale production of antimicrobial peptides. Among the many systems available for protein expression, Escherichia coli remains the most widely used host. Antimicrobial peptides produced in E. coli are often expressed as fusion proteins, which effectively masks these peptides' potential lethal effect towards the bacterial host and protects the peptides from proteolytic degradation. Although some carriers confer peptide solubility, others promote the formation of inclusion bodies. The present minireview considers the most commonly used carrier proteins for fusion expression of antimicrobial peptides in E. coli. The favourable properties of SUMO (small ubiquitin‐related modifier) as a novel fusion partner are also discussed.","biotechnology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. Its etiological agent has been convincingly identified as a new member of family Coronaviridae (SARS‐CoV). It causes serious damage to the respiratory system yet the mechanism is not clear. Infection‐induced apoptosis or necrosis is suspected but no direct evidence for this yet exists. To date, Vero E6 cells are the only cell line that could be used to replicate the virus with obvious CPE (cytopathic effect) in vitro. It is known for some viruses (including members of family Coronaviridae) that CPE can be caused either by virus‐induced apoptosis (active death) or cell necrosis (passive death). In this study, we examined the apoptosis in the SARS‐CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Indeed, the results do show that the CPE was induced by apoptosis rather than necrosis, shown by typical DNA fragmentation, through the existence of apoptotic bodies and swollen mitochondria. This observation has some implications for the SARS‐CoV pathogenicity: SARS‐CoV does induce apoptosis in cell cultures and might have the same effect in vivo, responsible for the severe damage of the respiratory system.

"Respiratory viruses are a constant concern for all demographics. Examples include established viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of respiratory infection in infants and young children, and emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which reached near pandemic levels in 2003, or H1N1 (swine) influenza. Despite this prevalence, traditional methods of virus detection are typically labor intensive and require several days to successfully confirm infection. Recently, however, nanoparticle‐based detection strategies have been employed in an effort to develop detection assays that are both sensitive and expedient. Each of these platforms capitalizes on the unique properties of nanoparticles for the detection of respiratory viruses. In this article, several nanoparticle‐based scaffolds are discussed.Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been functionalized with virus specific antibodies or oligonucleotides. In each of these constructs, AuNPs act as both an easily conjugated scaffolding system for biological molecules and a powerful fluorescence quencher. AuNPs have also been immobilized and used as electrochemical transducers. They efficiently serve as a conducting interface of electrocatalyic activity making them a powerful tool in this application. Quantum dots (QDs) posses unique fluorescence properties that have also been explored for their application to virus detection when combined with direct antibody conjugation or streptavidin‐biotin binding systems. QDs have an advantage over many traditional fluorophores because their fluorescence properties can be finely tuned and they are resistant to photobleaching. The development of these nanoparticle‐based detection strategies holds the potential to be a powerful method to quickly and easily confirm respiratory virus infection.

"The role of the novel respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV NL63) and human bocavirus (HBoV), in wheezing illness in children has not been well studied, especially in Africa. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hMPV, HCoV NL63 and HBoV in South African children with acute wheezing. A prospective study of consecutive children presenting with acute wheezing to a pediatric hospital from May 2004 to November 2005 was undertaken. A nasal swab was taken for reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and PCR for hMPV, HCoV NL63 and HBoV; when positive, the genes were sequenced. Shell vial culture for RSV, influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 was performed on every 5th sample. Two hundred and forty two nasal swabs were collected from 238 children (median age 12.4 months). A novel respiratory virus was found in 44/242 (18.2%). hMPV, HBoV, and HCoV NL63 was found in 20 (8.3%), 18 (7.4%), and 6 (2.4%) of samples, respectively. Fifteen of 59 (25%) samples were positive for other respiratory viruses. Viral co‐infections, occurred in 6/242 (2.5%). Phylogenetic analysis showed co‐circulation of hMPV and HCoV NL63 A and B lineages, although only HBoV genotype st2 was found.

"Glanders and melioidosis are caused by two distinct Burkholderia species and have generally been considered to have similar disease progression. While both of these pathogens are HHS/CDC Tier 1 agents, natural infection with both these pathogens is primarily through skin inoculation. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was used to compare disease following experimental subcutaneous challenge. Acute, lethal disease was observed in marmosets following challenge with between 26 and 1.2 × 108 cfu Burkholderia pseudomallei within 22–85 h. The reproducibility and progression of the disease were assessed following a challenge of 1 × 102 cfu of B. pseudomallei. Melioidosis was characterised by high levels of bacteraemia, focal microgranuloma progressing to non‐necrotic multifocal solid lesions in the livers and spleens and multi‐organ failure. Lethal disease was observed in 93% of animals challenged with Burkholderia mallei, occurring between 5 and 10.6 days. Following challenge with 1 × 102 cfu of B. mallei, glanders was characterised with lymphatic spread of the bacteria and non‐necrotic, multifocal solid lesions progressing to a multifocal lesion with severe necrosis and pneumonia. The experimental results confirmed that the disease pathology and presentation is strikingly different between the two pathogens.

"We tested, using a low starting dilution, sequential serum samples from dromedary camels, sheep and horses collected in Dubai from February/April to October of 2005 and from dromedary camels for export/import testing between Canada and USA in 2000–2001. Using a standard Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) neutralization test, serial sera from three sheep and three horses were all negative while sera from 9 of 11 dromedary camels from Dubai were positive for antibodies supported by similar results in a MERS‐CoV recombinant partial spike protein antibody ELISA. The two negative Dubai camels were both dromedary calves and remained negative over the 5 months studied. The six dromedary samples from USA and Canada were negative in both tests. These results support the recent findings that infection with MERS‐CoV or a closely related virus is not a new occurrence in camels in the Middle East. Therefore, interactions of MERS‐CoV at the human–animal interface may have been ongoing for several, perhaps many, years and by inference, a widespread pandemic may be less likely unless significant evolution of the virus allow accelerated infection and spread potential in the human population.","veterinary"
"Background The cysteine protease Der p 1 from the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is one of the most potent allergens known. An attractive mechanism for a component of Der p 1 allergenicity lies in its ability to cleave key regulatory molecules from leucocyte surfaces, subverting cellular function and driving abnormal immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses. Objective Although CD23, CD25 and CD40 have already been identified as major Der p 1 targets, other significant substrates may also exist. Methods To investigate this, knowledge of the proteolytic properties of Der p 1 was used to perform in silico digestion of human dendritic cell surface proteins, using the prediction of protease specificity (PoPS) bioinformatics tool, in conjunction with cellular in vitro analysis and cleavage site determination. Results Targets identified included DC‐SIGN and DC‐SIGNR, two C‐type lectins implicated mostly in pathogen trafficking. Treatment of positively expressing cells with Der p 1 led to loss of detectable surface DC‐SIGN and DC‐SIGNR. Digestion of purified soluble recombinant DC‐SIGN and DC‐SIGNR, followed by N‐terminal sequencing and MALDI mass spectrometry, indicated in each case one major cleavage site and several minor sites, the former correlating well with Der p 1 enzymology and the folded state of the substrate proteins. Loss of DC‐SIGN from the cell surface led to reduced binding of intracellular adhesion molecule‐3, an endogenous DC‐SIGN ligand expressed on naïve T cells which is thought to be involved in T‐helper type 1 cytokine signalling. Conclusion These data provide evidence of lectin involvement in the initiation of the allergic response and the value of using genome‐wide in silico digestion tools.","immunology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) causes SARS. The pathogenic mechanisms of SARS‐CoV remain poorly understood. Six cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated with the HKU39849 isolate of SARS‐CoV via four routes. After intranasal inoculation, the virus was isolated from respiratory swabs on days 2–7 postinoculation (p.i.) and virus genome was detected in intestinal tissues on day 7 p.i. Virus was not detected after intragastric inoculation. After intravenous inoculation, infectious virus was isolated from rectal swabs, and virus antigen was detected in intestinal cells on day 14 p.i. After intratracheal (i.t.) inoculation, virus antigen‐positive alveolar cells and macrophages were found in lung and infectious virus was detected in lymphoid and intestinal tissues. The peribronchial lymph nodes showed evidence of an immune response. Lung tissue and/or fluid and/or the peribronchial lymph node of the intratracheally inoculated animals had high TNF‐α, IL‐8 and IL‐12 levels. SARS lung lesions are only generated in monkeys by i.t. inoculation. The virus appears to spread into and perhaps via the intestinal and lymphatic systems. It has been suggested previously that viraemia may cause intestinal infections in SARS patients.","pathology"
"The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key regulator of systemic blood pressure and renal function and a key player in renal and cardiovascular disease. However, its (patho)physiological roles and its architecture are more complex than initially anticipated. Novel RAAS components that may add to our understanding have been discovered in recent years. In particular, the human homologue of ACE (ACE2) has added a higher level of complexity to the RAAS. In a short period of time, ACE2 has been cloned, purified, knocked‐out, knocked‐in; inhibitors have been developed; its 3D structure determined; and new functions have been identified. ACE2 is now implicated in cardiovascular and renal (patho)physiology, diabetes, pregnancy, lung disease and, remarkably, ACE2 serves as a receptor for SARS and NL63 coronaviruses. This review covers available information on the genetic, structural and functional properties of ACE2. Its role in a variety of (patho)physiological conditions and therapeutic options of modulation are discussed. Copyright © 2007 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

"For rapid and accurate quantitation of recombinant proteins during expression and after purification, we introduce a new tagging strategy that expresses both target proteins and limitedly tagged target proteins together in a single cell at a constant ratio by utilizing cis‐elements of programmed ‐1 ribosomal frameshifting (‐1RFS) as an embedded device. ‐1RFS is an alternative reading mechanism that effectively controls protein expression by many viruses. When a target gene is fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene with a ‐1RFS element implanted between them, the unfused target and the target‐GFP fusion proteins are expressed at a fixed ratio. The expression ratio between these two protein products is adjustable simply by changing ‐1RFS signals. This limited‐tagging system would be valuable for the real‐time monitoring of protein expression when optimizing expression condition for a new protein, and in monitoring large‐scale bioprocesses without a large metabolic burden on host cells. Furthermore, this strategy allows for the direct measurement of the quantity of a protein on a chip surface and easy application to proteomewide study of gene products. Biotechnol.

"Pandemic plans recommend phases of response to an emergent infectious disease (EID) outbreak, and are primarily aimed at preventing and mitigating human‐to‐human transmission. These plans carry presumptive weight and are increasingly being operationalized at the national, regional and international level with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO). The conventional focus of pandemic preparedness for EIDs of zoonotic origin has been on public health and human welfare. However, this focus on human populations has resulted in strategically important disciplinary silos. As the risks of zoonotic diseases have implications that reach across many domains outside traditional public health, including anthropological, environmental, and veterinary fora, a more inclusive ecological perspective is paramount for an effective response to future outbreaks.","social"
"Monoclonal antibodies are essential therapeutics and diagnostics in a large number of diseases. Moreover, they are essential tools in all sectors of life sciences. Although the great majority of monoclonal antibodies currently in use are of mouse origin, the use of human B cells to generate monoclonal antibodies is increasing as new techniques to tap the human B cell repertoire are rapidly emerging. Cloned lines of immortalized human B cells are ideal sources of monoclonal antibodies. In this review, we summarize our studies to the regulation of the replicative life span, differentiation, and maturation of B cells that led to the development of a platform that uses immortalization of human B cells by in vitro genetic modification for antibody development. We describe a number of human antibodies that were isolated using this platform and the application of the technique in other species. We also discuss the use of immortalized B cells as antigen‐presenting cells for the discovery of tumor neoantigens.","immunology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described and highly contagious respiratory infection. Many adult patients will develop progressive hypoxia, and a large proportion will develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), possibly related to massive and uncontrolled activation of the immune system. The mortality has been reported to be quite high, especially in the elderly with comorbid conditions. The causative agent has been identified as a novel coronavirus, and children appear to acquire the infection by close‐contact household exposure to an infected adult. However, the severity is much milder and the clinical progression much less aggressive in young children. The exact pathophysiology of SARS is still unclear, and the medical treatment of SARS remains controversial. The main treatment regime used in Hong Kong is a combination of ribavirin and steroid. To date, there have been no reported case fatalities in children with this disease. The success of reducing the burden of this infection in children will depend on proper isolation of infected adults early in the course of illness. Strict public health policy and quarantine measures are the key in controlling the infection in the community. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2003; 36:261–266. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","respiratory"
"Various mechanisms for the reversible formation of a covalent tetrahedral complex (TC) between papain and peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors were simulated by DFT calculations, applying the quantum mechanical/self consistent reaction field (virtual solvent) [QM/SCRF(VS)] approach. Only one mechanism correlates with the experimental kinetic data. The His–Cys catalytic diad is in an N/SH protonation state in the noncovalent papain–aldehyde Michaelis complex. His159 functions as a general base catalyst, abstracting a proton from the Cys25, whereas the activated thiolate synchronously attacks the inhibitor's carbonyl group. The final product of papain inhibition is the protonated neutral form of the hemithioacetal TC(OH), in agreement with experimental data. The predicted activation barrier g enz≠ = 5.2 kcal mol−1 is close to the experimental value of 6.9 kcal mol−1. An interpretation of the experimentally observed slow binding effect for peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors is presented. The calculated g cat≠ is much lower than the rate determining activation barrier of hemithioacetal formation in water, g w≠, in agreement with the concept that the preorganized electrostatic environment in the enzyme active site is the driving force of enzyme catalysis. We have rationalized the origin of the acidic and basic pKa's on the k2/KS versus pH bell‐shaped profile of papain inhibition by peptidyl aldehydes.

"Approximately 20,000–30,000 measles patients were reported in a surveillance of infectious diseases because of low vaccine coverage of 80% in Japan. Among them, some were thought to be secondary vaccine failure (SVF) with generally mild or non‐typical measles illness and sometimes became a source of further transmission. We have developed a new, sensitive, and rapid method to detect the measles virus genome by reverse transcription loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (RT‐LAMP). We examined 50 nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) samples that were obtained during the 1999 outbreak and stored at −70°C and fresh NPS, lymphocytes and sera from 11 patients in 2003. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and subjected to reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and RT‐LAMP. We detected the genomic RNA corresponding to at least 0.01–0.04 TCID50, 30–100 copies in samples by RT‐LAMP within 60 min after extraction of RNA, and all four genotypes isolated in Japan were equally amplified. Specific DNA amplification was monitored spectrophotometrically by real time turbidimeter and the quantity of RNA was calculated. Measles virus genome was detected in 44 of 50 stored NPS by RT‐PCR and in 49 by RT‐LAMP. The vaccine strain was discriminated from wild strains after sequencing the LAMP products. RT‐LAMP is a useful rapid diagnostic method for the detection of measles virus without any special apparatus, showing higher sensitivity than RT‐PCR, and expected to be applied for hospital‐based infection control and for laboratory‐based measles surveillance.

"Molecular diagnostic techniques, such as PCR, have become useful tools for the rapid etiological diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been evaluated for detecting most respiratory pathogens, and commercial assays are available for some pathogens. However, standardized protocols are needed before these assays are introduced into routine diagnostic use. For pneumonia, NAATs offer advantages over conventional tests for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and Chlamydia pneumoniae. For pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, PCR adds little to existing diagnostic tests, and is unable to distinguish pneumococcal colonization from infection when testing respiratory samples. Although less sensitive than culture‐based methods, several commercial molecular diagnostic assays have been developed for tuberculosis and are useful rapid tests for selected patients. PCR can now be considered the rapid diagnostic test of choice for pertussis and some respiratory virus infections. Further work is required to better characterize the role of molecular diagnostic tests for diagnosing lower respiratory tract infections, and to develop standard assays that can be readily adopted by routine diagnostic laboratories.","pathology"

The use of functionalized magnetic beads (MBs) in the development of electrochemical immuno‐ and genosensors has resulted in innovative and powerful detection strategies that may be applied to environmental, food and clinical analysis. This review describes current research on the combination of functionalized MBs with electrochemical detection for the development of magnetobiosensors applied to rapid, sensitive and specific detection of bioterrorism and biohazard agents.","electrochemistry"
"The main objective of this study was to examine the performance of protected zone ventilation (PZV) and hybrid protected zone ventilation (HPZV) to reduce the direct exposure to exhaled air from others' breathing. Experimental measurements are carried out to test the performance of PZV in a full‐scale office room with two breathing thermal manikins. The measurements were performed under three configurations, including two standing manikins at different distances: 0.35, 0.5, and 1.1 m. When the supply air velocity is increased to 4 m/s in the downward plane jet, the dimensionless concentration is 40% lower than for fully mixed ventilation, which can be considered as a measure of protection from the zoning condition. The measurement results showed that in both the PZV and the HPZV system it is possible to decrease the transmission of tracer gas from one manikin to the opposite manikin; therefore, it probably would reduce the risk of air borne cross‐infection between two people at the same relative positions. The results suggest that PZV and HPZV may be used to reduce the exposure of people in a protected zone from indoor pollutants emitted in a source zone.","public"
"The inhalation intake fraction was used as an indicator to compare effects of desktop personalized ventilation and mixing ventilation on personal exposure to directly released simulated cough droplets. A cough machine was used to simulate cough release from the front, back, and side of a thermal manikin at distances between 1 and 4 m. Cough droplet concentration was measured with an aerosol spectrometer in the breathing zone of a thermal manikin. Particle image velocimetry was used to characterize the velocity field in the breathing zone. Desktop personalized ventilation substantially reduced the inhalation intake fraction compared to mixing ventilation for all investigated distances and orientations of the cough release. The results point out that the orientation between the cough source and the breathing zone of the exposed occupant is an important factor that substantially influences exposure. Exposure to cough droplets was reduced with increasing distance between cough source and exposed occupant.","public"
"Inhaling indoor air is the primary means by which humans are exposed to bioaerosols. Considering bacteria, fungi, and viruses, this study reviews the dynamic processes that govern indoor concentrations and fates of biological particulate material. Bioaerosol behavior is strongly coupled to particle size; this study emphasizes the range 0.1–10 μm in aerodynamic diameter. The principle of material balance allows concentrations to be determined from knowledge of important source and removal processes. Sources reviewed here include outdoor air introduced by air exchange plus indoor emission from occupants, occupant activities, and moldy materials. Important mechanisms that remove bioaerosols from indoor air include air exchange, deposition onto indoor surfaces, and active filtration. The review summarizes knowledge about size‐dependent particle deposition in different regions of the respiratory tract, techniques for measuring indoor bioaerosols, and evidence for diseases caused by airborne exposure to bioaerosols. Future research challenges and opportunities are highlighted.","public"
"Previous studies regarding interunit dispersion used Reynolds‐averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models and thus obtained only mean dispersion routes and re‐entry ratios. Given that the envelope flow around a building is highly fluctuating, mean values could be insufficient to describe interunit dispersion. This study investigates the wind‐induced interunit dispersion around multistory buildings using the large eddy simulation (LES) method. This is the first time interunit dispersion has been investigated transiently using a LES model. The quality of the selected LES model is seriously assured through both experimental validation and sensitivity analyses. Two aspects are paid special attention: (i) comparison of dispersion routes with those provided by previous RANS simulations and (ii) comparison of timescales with those of natural ventilation and the survival times of pathogens. The LES results reveal larger dispersion scopes than the RANS results. Such larger scopes could be caused by the fluctuating and stochastic nature of envelope flows, which, however, is canceled out by the inherent Reynolds‐averaged treatment of RANS models. The timescales of interunit dispersion are comparable with those of natural ventilation. They are much shorter than the survival time of most pathogens under ordinary physical environments, indicating that interunit dispersion is a valid route for disease transmission.","public"
"Impact of recently discovered viruses on epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) is still unclear. We studied the impact of recently discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and new coronaviruses (HCoV‐NL63 and HKU1) on the global epidemiology of ARTI. From October 2006 to April 2007, 237 pediatric patients affected by ARTI were enrolled in our study. Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. One hundred twenty‐four out of 237 samples (52.3%) were positive for one or more viruses. Picornaviruses were the most prevalent viruses (n = 61, 43.6%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (n = 34, 24.3%) and Adenovirus (n = 25, 17.9%); hMPV (n = 9, 6.4%) was the fourth most common virus detected. HBoV and HCoV showed a low prevalence (respectively 2.9% and 2.1%). RSV was the prevalent agent of LRTI (38%). Viruses were identified in more than 50% of the studied ARTI, providing useful information on clinical features and epidemiology of specific agents affecting children in cold months. Although routine surveillance of respiratory viruses does not seem cost‐effective, continuous monitoring of ARTI etiology could be a useful tool for planning resources for the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents.

"The last two decades have witnessed the exponential development of DNA as a generic material instead of just a genetic material. The biological function, nanoscale geometry, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and molecular recognition capacity of DNA make it a promising candidate for the construction of novel functional nanomaterials. As a result, DNA has been recognized as one of the most appealing and versatile nanomaterial building blocks. Scientists have used DNA in this way to construct various amazing nanostructures, such as ordered lattices, origami, supramolecular assemblies, and even three‐dimensional objects. In addition, DNA has been utilized as a guide and template to direct the assembly of other nanomaterials including nanowires, free‐standing membranes, and crystals. Furthermore, DNA can also be used as structural components to construct bulk materials such as DNA hydrogels, demonstrating its ability to behave as a unique polymer. Overall, these novel DNA materials have found applications in various areas in the biomedical field in general, and nanomedicine in particular. In this review, we summarize the development of DNA assemblies, describe the innovative progress of multifunctional and bulk DNA materials, and highlight some real‐world nanomedical applications of these DNA materials. We also show our insights throughout this article for the future direction of DNA materials.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a severe infectious disease that has affected many countries and regions since 2002. A novel member of the coronavirus, SARS‐CoV, has been identified as the causative agent. However, the pathogenesis of SARS is still elusive. In this study, we used 2‐D DIGE and MS to analyze the protein profiles of plasma from SARS patients, in the search for proteomic alterations associated with the disease progression, which could provide some clues to the pathogenesis. To enrich the low‐abundance proteins in human plasma, two highly abundant proteins, albumin and IgG, were first removed. By comparing the plasma proteins of SARS patients with those of a normal control group, several proteins with a significant alteration were found. The up‐regulated proteins were identified as alpha‐1 acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha‐1 anti‐chymotrypsin and fetuin. The down‐regulated proteins were apolipoprotein A‐I, transferrin and transthyretin. Most of the proteins showed significant changes (up‐ or down‐regulated) in the progressive phase of disease, and there was a trend back to normal level during the convalescent phase. Among these proteins, the alterations of fetuin and anti‐chymotrypsin were further confirmed by Western blotting. Since all the up‐regulated proteins identified above are well‐known inflammation inhibitors, these results strongly suggest that the body starts inflammation inhibition to sustain the inflammatory response balance in the progression of SARS.","biochemistry"
"We previously developed two potent chemical classes that inhibit the essential papain‐like protease (PLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this study, we applied a novel approach to identify small fragments that act synergistically with these inhibitors. A fragment library was screened in combination with four previously developed lead inhibitors by fluorescence‐based enzymatic assays. Several fragment compounds synergistically enhanced the inhibitory activity of the lead inhibitors by approximately an order of magnitude. Surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that three fragments bind specifically to the PLpro enzyme. Mode of inhibition, computational solvent mapping, and molecular docking studies suggest that these fragments bind adjacent to the binding site of the lead inhibitors and further stabilize the inhibitor‐bound state. We propose potential next‐generation compounds based on a computational fragment‐merging approach. This approach provides an alternative strategy for lead optimization for cases in which direct co‐crystallization is difficult.","pharmacology"
"We investigated a topic‐based navigation guidance system in the World Health Organization portal, compared the link connection network and the semantic connection network derived from the guidance system, analyzed the characteristics of the 2 networks from the perspective of the node centrality (in_closeness, out_closeness, betweenness, in_degree, and out_degree), and provided the suggestions to optimize and enhance the topic‐based navigation guidance system. A mixed research method that combines the social network analysis method, clustering analysis method, and inferential analysis methods was used. The clustering analysis results of the link connection network were quite different from those of the semantic connection network. There were significant differences between the link connection network and the semantic network in terms of density and centrality. Inferential analysis results show that there were no strong correlations between the centrality of a node and its topic information characteristics. Suggestions for enhancing the navigation guidance system are discussed in detail. Future research directions, such as application of the same research method presented in this study to other similar public health portals, are also included.","information"

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new human infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality. The disease has been shown to be associated with a new coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). The clinical and epidemiological aspects of SARS have been described. Moreover, the viral genome of SARS‐CoV has been fully sequenced. However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS‐CoV are limited. In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS‐CoV using an in‐situ hybridization (ISH) technique. Among all the tissues studied, positive signals were seen in pneumocytes in the lungs and surface enterocytes in the small bowel. Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescence–fluorescence in‐situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS‐CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection. Whereas the lung pathology was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, the gut was relatively intact. These findings indicated that tissue responses to SARS‐CoV infection are distinct in different organs. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","pathology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a new coronavirus, SARS‐CoV. Pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature but extra‐pulmonary manifestations are also common. Factors that account for the wide spectrum of organ system involvement and disease severity are poorly understood and the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV infection remains unclear. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as the functional cellular receptor for SARS‐CoV. Studies of the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS‐CoV, and ACE2 protein expression, reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of this deadly disease. ACE2 is expressed at high level in the primary target cells of SARS‐CoV, namely pneumocytes and surface enterocytes of the small intestine. Despite the fact that SARS‐CoV can infect the lung and intestine, the tissue responses in these two organs are different. All other tissues and cell types expressing ACE2 may be potential targets of SARS‐CoV infection. Remarkably, endothelial cells, which express ACE2 to a high level, have not been shown to be infected by SARS‐CoV. There is also evidence that cell types without detectable ACE2 expression may also be infected by the virus. Furthermore, studies in a new human cell culture model have indicated that the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection. Therefore, other virus receptors or co‐receptors may be required in different tissues. Moreover, the interaction between SARS‐CoV and the immunological or lymphoid system remains to be defined. It is clear that we are only at the dawn of our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS. As our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms improves, a more rational approach to therapeutic and vaccine development can be designed in order to combat this new and fatal human disease.

"Human metapneumovirus was discovered recently respiratory virus implicated in both upper and lower respiratory tract infection. In children, the clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus are similar to those produced by respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild to severe diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of human metapneumovirus and other common respiratory viruses among admitted to hospital infants. From January 2006 to June 2006, 99 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children younger than 12 months in order to study respiratory viruses. Human metapneumovirus detection was performed by cell culture and two RT‐PCR targeting on polymerase and fusion genes. The latter gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. In 67/99 children (67%) at least one viral pathogen was identified, the viruses detected most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus (35%), human metapneumovirus (25%) and rhinovirus (19%). The results obtained in this study, show that: (1) human metapneumovirus is one of the most important viruses among children less than 12 months; (2) children infected with human metapneumovirus were significantly older than those infected by respiratory syncytial virus; (3) human metapneumovirus was associated more frequently with pneumonia whereas respiratory syncytial virus was only detected in patients with bronchiolitis; (4) there was a clear epidemiological succession pattern with only a small overlap among the viruses detected most frequently; (5) all human metapneumovirus samples were clustered within sublineage A2.

"Summary.  After World War II, mankind believed that infectious diseases were on the way to being defeated. Unfortunately, they still are the second worldwide cause of death. Globalization changes promote the emergence of new infections and pandemics; international deliveries and travelling facilitate the dissemination of infectious agents; man‐induced environmental changes create new opportunities for contacts between species, leading to infections in aberrant hosts, including man; global warming enables insects, a major vector of pathogens, to thrive in more countries. The main pandemics have been caused by viruses, such as HIV and novel subtypes of influenza viruses. In addition, prion proteins are a threat. The transmission of the Creutzfeld Jakob disease variant through blood transfusion and the recent discovery of prion protein in the spleen of a haemophilia patient are a matter of further concern. The end of the war against infectious diseases is not in sight. Mankind’s battle with pathogens has lasted millennia and is destined to continue.","hematology"
"Annexin A2 (p36) is usually present together with its natural ligand p11 as a heterotetramer complex, which has multiple biological functions depending on its cellular localization. However, the detailed mechanism of annexin A2 translocation and its physiological role in inflammation remain unclear. Here, we show that IFN‐γ stimulation enhances surface translocation of annexin A2 on lung epithelial cells. While total annexin A2 protein remains unchanged, the expression of p11 is upregulated via the IFN‐γ‐activated JAK2/STAT1 signal pathway. Notably, IFN‐γ‐induced p11 expression is required for annexin A2 translocation to the cell surface. Since annexin A2 lacks a signal peptide for surface translocation by the classical endoplasmic reticulum‐Golgi route, its mode of trafficking remains unclear. We observed that p11‐dependent surface translocation of annexin A2 is associated with the exosomal secretion pathway. The IFN‐γ‐induced increase of annexin A2 in the exosomes is blocked in p11‐silenced cells. Furthermore, IFN‐γ‐induced surface expression of annexin A2 mediates phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by lung epithelial cells. These findings provide insights into the surface translocation mechanism of annexin A2 and illustrate a pivotal function of surface annexin A2 in the phagocytic response to IFN‐γ. J. Cell.

"The occurrence of viral coinfections in childhood pneumonia has received little attention, probably because suitable detection methods have been lacking. Between November 2004 and October 2006, the presence of 14 respiratory viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with community‐acquired pneumonia were investigated using molecular or immunochromatographic techniques and/or viral culture. A total of 315 children (338 episodes) were included, and hospitalization was required in 178 episodes. At least one virus was detected in 66.9% of the episodes and simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was frequent (27% of the episodes with viral detection). The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (n = 67: 33 subgroup A, 33 subgroup B, 1 not typed), followed by human bocavirus (n = 48), rhinovirus (n = 46), human metapneumovirus (n = 39: 13 genotype A2, 8 B1, 5 B2, 1 A1, 12 not genotyped) and parainfluenza viruses (n = 38: 1 type 1, 3 type 2, 22 type 3, 11 type 4 and 1 not typed). The 14 viruses investigated were found in viral coinfections, which were more frequent in children aged less than 12 months. Except for adenovirus, the incidence of which was low, the percentage of viral coinfection ranged between 28.2% and 68.8%. Children with viral coinfection more frequently required hospital admission than those with single viral infection. It is concluded that viral coinfections are frequent in children aged less than 3 years old with community‐acquired pneumonia and can be a poor prognostic factor. J. Med.

"A limited number of drugs have been used for treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), all sharing the similar antiviral mechanism of inhibiting virus replication. This study investigates the anti‐HCMV activities of mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) from blocking virus entry and inhibiting virus spread. Recombinant human MBL was produced in CHO cells and native human MBL was isolated from human serum. A HCMV neutralization test was performed by pre‐treating HCMV with each diluted MBL solution. Then the treated HCMV was inoculated onto the human embryonic pulmonary fibroblasts (HELF), which was followed by HCMV‐DNA detection, PP65 positivity examination and confocal imaging of the infected cells. To test the activity of MBL in inhibiting viral spreading after viral invasion, HCMV growth inhibition test was performed. The infected cells were incubated with each diluted MBL, every 24 h, the supernatant was tested for HCMV‐DNA. After 72 h, cells were collected for HCMV‐DNA and PP65 examination. Then the cytopathic effect was observed and cell viability was measured at the 5 days after infection. HCMV neutralization test revealed 10 μg/mL MBL significantly decreased the HCMV invasion in HELF and the anti‐HCMV activity can be blocked by 20 mg/mL mannan. HCMV growth inhibition test indicated that at 48 h after HCMV invasion, the HCMV‐DNA level in the culture supernatant with 10 μg/mL MBL was lower than the control. After 72 h, both the HCMV‐DNA levels and PP65 positivity in cells incubated with MBL were reduced. This is the first to report on the anti‐HCMV activities of MBL by in vitro studies.","pathology"
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major cause of chronic liver disease with an estimated 170 million carriers worldwide. Current treatments have significant side effects and have met with only partial success. Therefore, alternative antiviral drugs that efficiently block virus production are needed. During recent decades, RNA interference (RNAi) technology has not only become a powerful tool for functional genomics but also represents a new therapeutic approach for treating human diseases including viral infections. RNAi is a sequence‐specific and post‐transcriptional gene silencing process mediated by double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA). As the HCV genome is a single‐stranded RNA that functions as both a messenger RNA (mRNA) and replication template, it is an attractive target for the study of RNAi‐based viral therapies.

To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS‐CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two‐hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post‐translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170–210, which includes the SR‐rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK62EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus‐strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

"Short interfering RNA (siRNA) functions directly in the cytoplasm, where it is assembled into an RNA‐induced silencing complex (RISC). The localized delivery of siRNA to a specific site in vivo is highly challenging. There are many disease states in which a systemic effect of RNAi may be desirable; some examples include non‐localized cancers, HIV, neurodegenerative diseases, respiratory viruses, and heart and vascular disease. In this Concept, we will focus on the localized delivery of siRNA to a target site using various delivery modalities. In certain tissues, such as the eye, central nervous system and lung, it has been demonstrated that a simple injection of naked siRNA will silence gene expression specifically in that tissue. To achieve local gene silencing in other tissues, a variety of approaches have been pursued to help stabilize the siRNA and facilitate uptake; they include chemical modification of the siRNA or complexation within liposomes or polymers to form nanoparticles. Recently, the use of macroscopic biomaterial scaffolds for siRNA delivery has been reported, and although there is still significant work to be done in this area to optimize the delivery systems, it is an important area of research that offers the potential for having great impact on the field of siRNA delivery.","chemistry"
"The last three decades have seen an alarming number of high‐profile outbreaks of new viruses and other pathogens, many of them emerging from wildlife. Recent outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza, and others highlight emerging zoonotic diseases as one of the key threats to global health. Similar emerging diseases have been reported in wildlife populations, resulting in mass mortalities, population declines, and even extinctions. In this paper, we highlight three examples of emerging pathogens: Nipah and Hendra virus, which emerged in Malaysia and Australia in the 1990s respectively, with recent outbreaks caused by similar viruses in India in 2000 and Bangladesh in 2004; West Nile virus, which emerged in the New World in 1999; and amphibian chytridiomycosis, which has emerged globally as a threat to amphibian populations and a major cause of amphibian population declines. We discuss a new, conservation medicine approach to emerging diseases that integrates veterinary, medical, ecologic, and other sciences in interdisciplinary teams. These teams investigate the causes of emergence, analyze the underlying drivers, and attempt to define common rules governing emergence for human, wildlife, and plant EIDs. The ultimate goal is a risk analysis that allows us to predict future emergence of known and unknown pathogens.","multidisciplinary"
"Our understanding of origins and spread of emerging infectious diseases has increased dramatically because of recent applications of phylogenetic theory. Iridoviruses are emerging pathogens that cause global amphibian epizootics, including tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) die‐offs throughout western North America. To explain phylogeographical relationships and potential causes for emergence of western North American salamander iridovirus strains, we sequenced major capsid protein and DNA methyltransferase genes, as well as two noncoding regions from 18 geographically widespread isolates. Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data from the capsid protein gene showed shallow genetic divergence (< 1%) among salamander iridovirus strains and monophyly relative to available fish, reptile, and other amphibian iridovirus strains from the genus Ranavirus, suggesting a single introduction and radiation. Analysis of capsid protein sequences also provided support for a closer relationship of tiger salamander virus strains to those isolated from sport fish (e.g. rainbow trout) than other amphibian isolates. Despite monophyly based on capsid protein sequences, there was low genetic divergence among all strains (< 1.1%) based on a supergene analysis of the capsid protein and the two noncoding regions. These analyses also showed polyphyly of strains from Arizona and Colorado, suggesting recent spread. Nested clade analyses indicated both range expansion and long‐distance colonization in clades containing virus strains isolated from bait salamanders and the Indiana University axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) colony. Human enhancement of viral movement is a mechanism consistent with these results. These findings suggest North American salamander ranaviruses cause emerging disease, as evidenced by apparent recent spread over a broad geographical area.","evolutionary"
"Diverse serine and cysteine proteases as well as alkaline proteinases and elastases play a crucial role in numerous biological processes. Natural peptide aldehydes such as the “microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor” (MAPI, 1) are valuable tools to characterize novel enzymes and to study their function in nature. Within a drug discovery program we wanted to design and explore non‐natural MAPI congeners with novel biological profiles. To that end we devised a simple, practical, and scalable synthesis of MAPI 1 from readily available amino acid building blocks. The modular nature of our approach allows convenient structural modification of the MAPI backbone.","pharmacology"

"Viruses are important pathogens causing respiratory tract infections both in the community and health‐care facility settings. They are extremely common causes of morbidity in the competent hosts and some are associated with significant mortality in the compromised individuals. With wider application of molecular techniques, novel viruses are being described and old viruses are found to have new significance in different epidemiological and clinical settings. Some of these emerging pathogens may have the potential to cause pandemics or global spread of a severe disease, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza. Antiviral therapy of viral respiratory infections is often unnecessary in the competent hosts because most of them are self‐limiting and effective agents are not always available. In the immunocompromised individuals or for infections caused by highly pathogenic viruses, such as avian influenza viruses (AIV), antiviral treatment is highly desirable, despite the fact that many of the agents may not have undergone stringent clinical trials. In immunocompetent hosts, antiviral therapy can be stopped early because adaptive immune response can usually be mounted within 5–14 days. However, the duration of antiviral therapy in immunosuppressed hosts depends on clinical and radiological resolution, the degree and duration of immunosuppression, and therefore maintenance therapy is sometimes needed after the initial response. Immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis appear to be promising directions for future research. Appropriate and targeted immunomodulation may play an important adjunctive role in some of these infections by limiting the extent of end‐organ damage and multi‐organ failure in some fulminant infections.","respiratory"
"Sensitization of the humoral immune response to invading viruses and production of antiviral antibodies forms part of the host antiviral repertoire. Paradoxically, for a number of viral pathogens, under certain conditions, antibodies provide an attractive means of enhanced virus entry and replication in a number of cell types. Known as antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, the phenomenon occurs when virus‐antibody immunocomplexes interact with cells bearing complement or Fc receptors, promoting internalization of the virus and increasing infection. Frequently associated with exacerbation of viral disease, ADE of infection presents a major obstacle to the prevention of viral disease by vaccination and is thought to be partly responsible for the adverse effects of novel antiviral therapeutics such as intravenous immunoglobulins. There is a growing body of work examining the intracellular signaling pathways and epitopes responsible for mediating ADE, with a view to aiding rational design of antiviral strategies. With in vitro studies also confirming ADE as a feature of infection for a growing number of viruses, challenges remain in understanding the multilayered molecular mechanisms of ADE and its effect on viral pathogenesis.","immunology"
"The antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases for more than 60 years. Even today new indications evolve due to the complex mode of action of these compounds. Due to the fear of side effects, especially irreversible retinopathy, their use is often limited. These side‐effects, however, are a consequence of excessive daily dosages. An effective, safe therapy needs correct dosing, i. e. adherence to maximal daily dosages of 3.5(–4) mg chloroquine or 6(–6.5) mg hydroxychloroquine per kilogram ideal body weight. If the actual body weight is lower than the ideal body weight, this actual weight is used for the calculation of the dosage. Observing these limits allows a rather safe therapy of the diseases like lupus erythematosus, REM syndrome, porphyria cutanea tarda (2 × 125 mg chloroquine/week), cutaneous sarcoidosis and dermatomyositis. If standard therapies fail, then antimalarials can be tried to treat Sjögren syndrome, granu‐loma annulare or erosive lichen planus. If therapy fails, either can be combined with quinacrine to increase their effectiveness. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are indispensable and well‐tolerated essential drugs in dermatology and especially suited as part of a combination scheme, for example with corticosteroids, as they act synergistically and reduce side‐effects.","dermatology"
"Limited information is available on the non‐influenza etiology and epidemiology of influenza‐like illness (ILI) in China. From April 2011 to March 2014, we collected oropharyngeal swabs from children less than 5 years of age with symptoms of ILI who presented to the outpatient departments of Suzhou University Affiliated Children's Hospital (SCH). We used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt‐PCR) or PCR to detect 11 respiratory viruses. Among 3,662 enrolled ILI patients, 1,292 (35.3%) tested positive for at least one virus. Influenza virus (16.9%) was detected most frequently (influenza A 7.4%, influenza B 9.5%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (5.6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1–4 (4.8%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (3.8%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (3.5%), and adenovirus (ADV) (3.0%). Co‐infections were identified in 108 (2.9%) patients. Influenza virus predominantly circulated in January–March and June–July. The 2013–2014 winter peaks of RSV and influenza overlapped. Compared with other virus positive cases, influenza positive cases were more likely to present with febrile seizure, and RSV positive cases were more likely to present with cough and wheezing, and were most frequently diagnosed with pneumonia. These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of ILI among children less than 5 years of age in Suzhou, China. Influenza is not only the most frequently identified pathogen but it is also the only vaccine preventable illness among the 11 pathogens tested. Such findings suggest the potential value of exploring value of influenza vaccination among this influenza vaccination target group. J. Med.

"Objectives: During the winter outbreak of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in China, the number of confirmed cases and the fatal cases has grown rapidly. We describe the clinical characteristics of hospitalized children with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in Shenzhen, China, November–December 2009. Methods: Using a standardized form, we collected data on 148 hospitalized children. 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection was confirmed in nasopharyngeal swab specimens with the use of a real‐time reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction assay. Results: Of the 148 hospitalized children with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection, 81 (55%) were 5 years of age or older and 85% of the patients were previously healthy. The common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (89%), runny nose (36.5%), vomiting (24%), sore throat (19.6%), wheezing (18%), abdominal pain (16%), mental status changes (9%), seizures (6%), diarrhea (6%), myalgia (6%), and chest pain (4%). Twenty‐nine (20%) patients were admitted to an ICU, 10 (7%) patients required mechanical ventilation. The overall complication rate was 65.5%, they were pneumonia in 94 (64%), neurologic complications in 18 (12%), parapneumonic effusion in 12 (8%) and myocarditis in 7 (5%). One hundred seven (72%) patients received oseltamivir treatment, 34 (23%) received within 48 hr after the onset of symptoms. All patients received antibiotics before admission or on admission. One hundred forty‐four (97%) patients were discharged; four (3%) previously healthy patients died, three died from severe encephalopathy, one died from secondary fungal meningitis. Conclusion: Hospitalized children with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection can have a wide range of presentation and clinical complications including neurologic complications.

"Protein 3a is a 274 amino acid polytopic channel protein with three putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS‐CoV). Synthetic peptides corresponding to each of its three individual transmembrane domains (TMDs) are reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers. Only TMD2 and TMD3 induce channel activity. Reconstitution of the peptides as TMD1 + TMD3 as well as TMD2 + TMD3 in a 1 : 1 mixture induces membrane activity for both mixtures. In a 1 : 1 : 1 mixture, channel like behavior is almost restored. Expression of full length 3a and reconstitution into artificial lipid bilayers reveal a weak cation selective (PK ≈ 2 PCl) rectifying channel.

"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle for normal cell function and homeostasis. Disturbance in the protein folding process in the ER, termed ER stress, leads to the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) that encompasses a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways. The UPR can either restore ER homeostasis or activate pro‐apoptotic pathways depending on the type of insults, intensity and duration of the stress, and cell types. ER stress and the UPR have recently been linked to inflammation in a variety of human pathologies including autoimmune, infectious, neurodegenerative, and metabolic disorders. In the cell, ER stress and inflammatory signaling share extensive regulators and effectors in a broad spectrum of biological processes. In spite of different etiologies, the two signaling pathways have been shown to form a vicious cycle in exacerbating cellular dysfunction and causing apoptosis in many cells and tissues. However, the interaction between ER stress and inflammation in many of these diseases remains poorly understood. Further understanding of the biochemistry, cell biology, and physiology may enable the development of novel therapies that spontaneously target these pathogenic pathways. J. Cell.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) exhibits a high mortality rate and the potential for rapid epidemic spread. Additionally, it has a poorly defined clinical presentation, and no known treatment or prevention methods. Collectively, these factors underscore the need for early diagnosis. Molecular tests have been developed to detect SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) RNA using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) with varying levels of sensitivity. However, RNA amplification methods have been demonstrated to be more sensitive for the detection of some RNA viruses. We therefore developed a real‐time nucleic acid sequence‐based amplification (NASBA) test for SARS‐CoV. A number of primer/beacon sets were designed to target different regions of the SARS‐CoV genome, and were tested for sensitivity and specificity. The performance of the assays was compared with RT‐PCR assays. A multi‐target real‐time NASBA application was developed for detection of SARS‐CoV polymerase (Pol) and nucleocapsid (N) genes. The N targets were found to be consistently more sensitive than the Pol targets, and the real‐time NASBA assay demonstrates equivalent sensitivity when compared to testing by real‐time RT‐PCR. A multi‐target real‐time NASBA assay has been successfully developed for the sensitive detection of SARS‐CoV. J. Med. Virol. 77:602–608, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, inc.","virology"
"Alignment of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences is a fundamental component of sequence‐based molecular phylogenetic studies. Here we examined how different alignment methods affect the phylogenetic trees that are inferred from the alignments. We used simulations to determine how alignment errors can lead to systematic biases that affect phylogenetic inference from those sequences. We compared four approaches to sequence alignment: progressive pairwise alignment, simultaneous multiple alignment of sequence fragments, local pairwise alignment and direct optimization. When taking into account branch support, implied alignments produced by direct optimization were found to show the most extreme behaviour (based on the alignment programs for which nearly equivalent alignment parameters could be set) in that they provided the strongest support for the correct tree in the simulations in which it was easy to resolve the correct tree and the strongest support for the incorrect tree in our long‐branch‐attraction simulations. When applied to alignment‐sensitive process partitions with different histories, direct optimization showed the strongest mutual influence between the process partitions when they were aligned and phylogenetically analysed together, which makes detecting recombination more difficult. Simultaneous alignment performed well relative to direct optimization and progressive pairwise alignment across all simulations. Rather than relying upon methods that integrate alignment and tree search into a single step without accounting for alignment uncertainty, as with implied alignments, we suggest that simultaneous alignment using the similarity criterion, within the context of information available on biological processes and function, be applied whenever possible for sequence‐based phylogenetic analyses.","evolutionary"
"A strategy for the selective in vivo activation of prodrugs by proteases is presented. The approach is based on the design of polythiol peptides able to neutralize the toxicity of As(III) through chelation, and contemporarily to be recognized as substrates of a disease‐linked specific protease. Enzyme digestion implies conversion of such polythiol peptides into monothiol fragments with irreversible loss of the ability to chelate the metalloid, thus triggering the release in its free and pharmacologically effective form. The proteases whose activity appears dramatically up‐regulated in various pathologies, ranging from cancer to infectious diseases, can be conveniently employed as prodrug activators in the disease microenvironment. The design of the representative peptide shown here has been assisted by molecular modeling in order to fulfill the dual characteristic to be an efficient As(III) chelator and simultaneously a substrate of the matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) whose activity results dramatically increased at the surface of cells affected by several pathologies.

"Most of the SARS‐CoV‐infected patients spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention while a small percentage succumbed to the disease. Here, we characterized temporal changes in N protein‐specific and S glycoprotein‐specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in infected patients who have either recovered from or succumbed to SARS‐CoV infection. Recovered patients were found to have higher and sustainable levels of both N protein‐specific and S glycoprotein‐specific Nab responses, suggesting that antibody responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS‐CoV‐infected patients.

"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children worldwide. In New Zealand, infants with RSV disease are hospitalized at a higher rate than other industrialized countries, without a proportionate increase in known risk factors. The molecular epidemiology of RSV in New Zealand has never been described. Therefore, we analyzed viral attachment glycoprotein (G) gene sequences from 106 RSV subgroup A isolates collected in New Zealand between 1967 and 2003, and 38 subgroup B viruses collected between 1984 and 2004. Subgroup A and B sequences were aligned separately, and compared to sequences of viruses isolated from other countries during a similar period. Genotyping and clustering analyses showed RSV in New Zealand is similar and temporally related to viruses found in other countries. By quantifying temporal clustering, we found subgroup B viruses clustered more strongly than subgroup A viruses. RSV B sequences displayed more variability in stop codon usage and predicted protein length, and had a higher degree of predicted O‐glycosylation site changes than RSV A. The mutation rate calculated for the RSV B G gene was significantly higher than for RSV A. Together, these data reveal that RSV subgroups exhibit different patterns of evolution, with subgroup B viruses evolving faster than A. J. Med.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) is the causative agent of SARS. The S protein of SARS‐CoV is a major target for neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in infected patients. We developed a neutralization assay using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing SARS‐CoV‐S protein (VSV‐SARS‐St19). A total of 56 serum samples collected from 22 healthcare workers in the Hanoi French Hospital during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were evaluated and compared to the conventional neutralizing assay using infectious SARS‐CoV. The results of the neutralization assay using VSV‐SARS‐St19 pseudotype showed good correlations with those using infectious SARS‐CoV. The newly developed neutralization assay was more sensitive to low antibody titers in serum samples. Thus, the VSV‐SARS‐St19 is a useful tool for detecting Nabs against SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

"Zoonotic pathogens, including hantaviruses, are maintained in the environment by causing persistent infection in the absence of disease in their reservoir hosts. Spillover of hantaviruses to humans can cause severe disease that is mediated by excessive proinflammatory responses. The mechanisms mediating hantaviral persistence in rodent reservoirs remain largely unknown. Male Norway rats were inoculated with their species‐specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), and viral RNA, cytokine, and chemokine responses were evaluated in spleen and lung tissue. More viral RNA was detectable in the lungs than spleen, with copies of SEOV peaking 15–30 days post‐inoculation (p.i.) and persisting for 60 days p.i. In the lungs, the expression and production of proinflammatory mediators (i.e., IL‐1β, IL‐6, TNF‐α, IFN‐γ, CCL5, CCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL10, VCAM, VEGF, and NOS2) remained at or below baseline throughout SEOV infection; whereas, regulatory factors, including TGF‐β and FoxP3 were elevated. Conversely, in the spleen, proinflammatory responses were induced while regulatory responses remained unchanged during infection. To determine whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate hantavirus persistence in the lungs, male rats were administered rIL‐1β or vehicle for 30 days during SEOV infection. SEOV persistence and shedding were not affected by IL‐1β treatment. Proinflammatory responses were elevated in rIL‐1β‐treated rats, but remained within physiological levels, suggesting that supra‐physiological concentrations may be necessary for viral clearance at the cost of causing disease. Elevated regulatory responses may suppress excessively high proinflammatory responses at a site of elevated SEOV replication to contribute to viral persistence and prevent proinflammatory‐mediated disease in reservoir hosts.

"Taiwan suffered from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Our laboratory performed a series of virology and serology tests for SARS patients admitted to our hospital. Cross‐reactivity was found when testing for antibody against human T‐cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in one patient with SARS. Therefore, antibodies against HTLV were examined in paired‐sera from 26 SARS patients. ELISA and a neutralization test were used to measure anti‐SARS antibodies. Seroconversion for antibody against SARS‐CoV was observed in all patients. Surprisingly, with the use of ELISA for HTLV, sera for 13 patients were positive for HTLV (50%), and seroconversion for HTLV was also observed in 10 patients (38.5%). Western blot for HTLV on those 26 paired‐sera from 13 HTLV‐positive patients displayed 5 positive results for HTLV‐I, 7 positive results for HTLV‐II, 1 positive result for both HTLV‐I and II, 9 negative results for either HTLV‐I or HTLV‐II, and 4 “indeterminate” results. The findings that antibody to HTLV can be detected in blood samples collected from SARS patients provide important information for safe handling of blood products. Without such knowledge, blood products can be discarded mistakenly even though they contain anti‐SARS‐CoV antibodies that may be potentially valuable for SARS therapy. J. Med.

"Detection of a broad number of respiratory viruses is not undertaken currently for the diagnosis of acute respiratory infection due to the large and always increasing list of pathogens involved. A 1‐year study was undertaken on children hospitalized consecutively for acute respiratory infection in a Pediatric Department in Rome to characterize the viruses involved. Two hundred twenty‐seven children were enrolled in the study with a diagnosis of asthma, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, or laringo‐tracheo bronchitis. A molecular approach was adopted using specific reverse transcription (RT)‐PCR assays detecting 13 respiratory viruses including metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the novel coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1; most amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm positive results and differentiate the strain. Viral pathogens were detected in 97 samples (42.7%), with 4.8% of dual infections identified; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 17.2% of children, followed by rhinovirus (9.7%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) (7.5%), and influenza type A (4.4%). Interestingly, more than half the patients (9/17) that have rhinovirus as the sole respiratory pathogen had pneumonia. HMPV infected children below 3 years in two peaks in March and June causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia. One case of NL63 infection is described, documenting NL63 circulation in central Italy.

"Lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death in children worldwide. Studies on the epidemiology and clinical associations of the four human non‐SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) using sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of HCoV infections worldwide. Pediatric respiratory specimens (1,683) submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory over a 1‐year period (December 2004–November 2005) that were negative for seven respiratory viruses by conventional methods were tested for RNA of four HCoVs using sensitive RT‐PCR assays. Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 84 (5.0%) specimens: HCoV‐NL63 in 37 specimens, HCoV‐OC43 in 34, HCoV‐229E in 11, and HCoV‐HKU1 in 2. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during winter months, and over 62% were in previously healthy children. Twenty‐six (41%) coronavirus positive patients had evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 17 (26%) presented with vomiting and/or diarrhea, and 5 (8%) presented with meningoencephalitis or seizures. Respiratory specimens from one immunocompromised patient were persistently positive for HCoV‐229E RNA for 3 months. HCoV‐NL63‐positive patients were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalized (P = 0.02) and to have a LRTI (P = 0.04) than HCoV‐OC43‐positive patients. HCoVs are associated with a small, but significant number (at least 2.4% of total samples submitted), of both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses in children in Colorado. Our data raise the possibility that HCoV may play a role in gastrointestinal and CNS disease. Additional studies are needed to investigate the potential roles of HCoVs in these diseases. J. Med.

"Actinomycin‐D (Act‐D) and other inhibitors of RNA synthesis induce extensive and rapid apoptosis in the lepidopteran insect cells. Interestingly, a similar effect is not observed in the case of protein synthesis shutdown, implying that certain RNA species may be critically required for cell survival. In order to assess whether depletion of certain anti‐apoptotic microRNAs may result in insect cell apoptosis induced by these transcriptional inhibitors, we inhibited two antiapoptotic microRNAs, viz. bantam and miR‐14 (microRNA‐14), with known functions in insect systems, by transfecting lepidopteran Sf9 cell line (derived from Spodoptera frugiperda) with sequence‐specific inhibitory anti‐miRs. Our results indicate that miR‐14 is indeed required for constitutive cell survival as its inhibition caused considerable apoptosis. Importantly, exogenous supplementation with the mimics of miR‐14 precursor molecules could partially inhibit the Act‐D‐induced Sf9 cell death. Further, our results indicate that miR‐14 may function downstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release in preventing Act‐D‐induced apoptosis, implying possible inhibitory interactions with caspases as reported previously in other organisms. While the microRNA species are known to regulate cell death in Drosophila, which belongs the insect order Diptera, the present study demonstrates a definitive antiapoptotic role of miR‐14 in lepidopteran apoptosis as well. Our study also indicates that additional microRNA species may be regulating lepidopteran cell survival and death, thus warranting further in‐depth investigations into these important mechanisms of cell death. Since lepidopteran cells are an excellent model for general stress resistance, this study presents important information about their stress response mechanisms.","cell"
"The spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) is important for vaccine development. STR2 (an 88 kDa truncated SARS‐CoV TW1 S protein carrying the S fragments S‐74‐253, S‐294‐739, and S‐1129‐1255) is capable of expressing a major form of glycoprotein as endo H‐sensitive (∼115 kDa) in CHO cells. To establish stable expressing cell clones, we transfected CHO/dhFr‐cells with the amplifiable vectors ISID (IRES‐driven dhfr) and ISIZ (SV40‐driven dhfr) to select stepwise MTX, and observed enhanced ∼115 kDa glycoform generation through gene amplification. Following stepwise MTX selection, we compared gene amplification levels between two vectors in engineered CHO cell chromosomes. These results confirm that the IRES‐driven dhfr promoter generates greater gene amplification, which in turn enhances STR2 expression. Our results indicate that the ∼115 kDa glycoform of STR2 protein was capable of increasing after gene amplification. The STR2 glycoform did not change between suspension and serum‐free cultures, suggesting that the stable and amplified cell clones analyzed in this study have potential for producing homologous STR2 on a large scale. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

"Human periodontitis is associated with a wide range of bacteria and viruses and with complex innate and adaptive immune responses. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses are major suspected pathogens of periodontitis, and a combined herpesvirus–bacterial periodontal infection can potentially explain major clinical features of the disease. Cytomegalovirus infects periodontal macrophages and T‐cells and elicits a release of interleukin‐1β and tumor necrosis factor‐α. These proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the host defense against the virus, but they also have the potential to induce alveolar bone resorption and loss of periodontal ligament. Gingival fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus also exhibit diminished collagen production and release of an increased level of matrix metalloproteinases. This article reviews innate and adaptive immunity to cytomegalovirus and suggests that immune responses towards cytomegalovirus can play roles in controlling, as well as in exacerbating, destructive periodontal disease.","dentistry"
"This review highlights the growing importance of protein epitope mimetics in the discovery of new biologically active molecules and their potential applications in drug and vaccine research. The focus is on folded β‐hairpin mimetics, which are designed to mimic β‐hairpin motifs in biologically important peptides and proteins. An ever‐growing number of protein crystal structures reveal how β‐hairpin motifs often play key roles in protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid interactions. This review illustrates how using protein structures as a starting point for small‐molecule mimetic design can provide novel ligands as protein–protein interaction inhibitors, as protease inhibitors, and as ligands for chemokine receptors and folded RNA targets, as well as novel antibiotics to combat the growing health threat posed by the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. The β‐hairpin antibiotics are shown to target a β‐barrel outer membrane protein (LptD) in Pseudomonas sp., which is essential for the biogenesis of the outer cell membrane. Another exciting prospect is that protein epitope mimetics will be of increasing importance in synthetic vaccine design, in the emerging field of structural vaccinology. Crystal structures of protective antibodies bound to their pathogen‐derived epitopes provide an ideal starting point for the design of synthetic epitope mimetics. The mimetics can be delivered to the immune system in a highly immunogenic format on the surface of synthetic virus‐like particles. The scientific challenges in molecular design remain great, but the potential significance of success in this area is even greater.

"One of the major challenges in the drug development process is biodistribution across epithelia and intracellular drug targeting. Cellular membrane heterogeneity is one of the major drawbacks in developing efficient and sustainable drug delivery systems, which brings the need to study their interaction with lipids in order to unravel their mechanisms of action and improve their delivery capacities. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are able to translocate almost any cell membrane carrying cargo molecules. However, different CPP use different entry mechanisms, which are often concentration‐dependent and cargo‐dependent. Being able to quantify the lipid affinity of CPP is of obvious importance and can be achieved by studying the partition extent of CPP into lipid bilayers. The partition constant (Kp) reflects the lipid–water partition extent. However, all currently available methodologies are only suitable to determine the partition of single molecules into lipid membranes or entities, being unsuitable to determine the partition of bimolecular or higher order supramolecular complexes. We derived and tested a mathematical model to determine the Kp of supramolecular CPP‐cargo complexes from fluorescence spectroscopy data, using DNA oligomers as a model cargo. As a proof‐of‐concept example, the partition extent of two new membrane active peptides derived from dengue virus capsid protein (DENV C protein) with potential CPP properties, in both scenarios (free peptide and complexed with a molecular cargo), were tested. We were able to identify the lipid affinity of these CPP:DNA complexes, thus gaining valuable insights into better CPP formulations.

"Background:  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly discovered disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The present study studied the longitudinal profile of antibodies against SARS‐coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) in SARS patients and evaluated the clinical significance of these antibodies. Methods:  Two methods, ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent assay, were used for the detection of the anti‐SARS‐CoV IgG and IgM in 335 serial sera from 98 SARS patients. In 18 patients, serum antibody profiles were investigated and antibody neutralization tests were performed from 7 to 720 days after the onset of symptoms. Results:  The ratios of positive IgG/IgM by ELISA were 0/0, 45.4/39.4, 88.6/71.4, 96/88, 100/48.6, 100/30.9, 100/17.1, 100/0 per cent, respectively, on 1–7, 8–14, 15–21, 22–28, 29–60, 61–90, 91–180 and 181–720 days after the onset of symptoms. Antibodies were not detected within the first 7 days of illness, but IgG titre increased dramatically on day 15, reaching a peak on day 60, and remained high until day 180 from when it declined gradually until day 720. IgM was detected on day 15 and rapidly reached a peak, then declined gradually until it was undetectable on day 180. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the convalescence sera from SARS patients. Conclusion:  The persistence of detectable IgG antibodies and neutralizing viral antibodies for up to 720 days suggest that SARS patients may be protected from recurrent SARS‐CoV infection for up to 2 years.","respiratory"
"In a previous issue of Zygon (Carvalho 2007), I explored the role of scientists—especially those engaging the science‐religion dialogue—within the arena of global equity health, world poverty, and human rights. I contended that experimental biologists, who might have reduced agency because of their professional workload or lack of individual resources, can still unite into collective forces with other scientists as well as human rights organizations, medical doctors, and political and civic leaders to foster progressive change in our world. In this article, I present some recent findings from research on three emerging viruses—HIV, dengue, and rotavirus—to explore the factors that lead to the geographical expansion of these viruses and the increase in frequency of the infectious diseases they cause. I show how these viruses are generating problems for geopolitical stability, human rights, and equity health care for developing nations that are already experiencing a growing poverty crisis. I suggest some avenues of future research for the scientific community for the movement toward resolution of these problems and indicate where the science‐religion field can be of additional aid.","social"

"Glycyrrhizin (1), the main active principle of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) roots, is extensively used in herbal medicines, in pharmaceutical preparations and confectionery products. A feasible and reliable method which allows the simultaneous analysis of 1 and its aglycone, 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid (2), by means of an isocratic HPLC procedure is described. The system uses a C8 column as the stationary phase, and a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, water and glacial acetic acid as the mobile phase. Good linearity was found in the concentration ranges 1–50 and 0.05–2.50 µg/mL for 1 and 2, respectively. A simple and rapid sample pre‐treatment, based on the extraction of the two analytes with a mixture of water and ethanol, was developed for the examination of liquorice confectionery products and root samples. The HPLC method was shown to be appropriate, in terms of precision and feasibility, for the quality control of the analytes in these matrices. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","plant"
"Identification of mutations in mutants derived chemically is a difficult and relatively random process. NimbleGen Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) was assessed as an inexpensive, rapid method of identifying mutations in the temperature‐sensitive mutant tsm5 of the K181 (Birmingham) variant of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). This genome resequencing approach requires an established genome sequence as a reference. Comparison of tsm5 and the K181 (Birmingham) variant with the published K181 (Perth) MCMV genomic sequence revealed a total of 10 synonymous and 15 non‐synonymous SNPs in tsm5 and 14 of the latter were confirmed by sequencing. Thus, while CGS cannot be relied upon to identify correctly all mutations it was helpful for identifying a large number of mutations for further investigation that could contribute to the ts phenotype of tsm5.

"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a common etiological agent of acute respiratory tract infections. HCoV infections, especially those caused by the two HCoVs identified most recently, NL63 and HKU‐1, have not been characterized fully. To evaluate the prevalence and clinical presentations of HKU1 and NL63 in adults with acute respiratory tract infections, an investigation of HCoV infections in Beijing, China from 2005 to 2009 was performed by using reverse transcriptase PCR assays and sequencing analysis. Among 8,396 respiratory specimens studied, 87 (1%) clinical samples were positive for HCoVs, of which 50 samples (0.6% of the total) were positive for HCoV‐OC43, 15 (0.2%) for HCoV‐229E, 14 (0.2%) for HCoV‐HKU1, and 8 (0.1%) for HCoV‐NL63. The prevalence of HCoV infection in adults exhibited distinct seasonal fluctuations during the study period. In addition, patients positive for HCoV‐229E infections were more likely to be co‐infected with other respiratory viruses. Enterovirus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3 were the most common viruses found in patients with HCoV infections. The demographic and clinical data present in this study of HCoV infections in adults with acute respiratory tract infections should improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of HCoVs. J. Med.

"Background:  This study sought to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 replication using small interfering RNA which targeting infected‐cell polypeptide 4 genes to mediate transcription of early and late viral genes in herpes simplex virus type 1 lytic (productive) infection in retina epithelial cells. Methods:  After pre‐ or post‐infecting with herpes simplex virus type 1, small interfering RNAs were transfected into retina epithelial cells. The antiviral effects of small interfering RNA were evaluated by Western blot, plaque assays, indirect immunofluorescence and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The viral titre was detected by the 50% tissue culture infective dose method. Results:  Small interfering RNA decreased infected‐cell polypeptide 4 expression in retina epithelial cells that were infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 before or after small interfering RNA transfection. Compared with herpes simplex virus type 1 infection alone or transfection with negative control small interfering RNA, the viral titre and the retina epithelial cell cytopathic effect were significantly decreased in retina epithelial cells transfected with infected‐cell polypeptide 4‐targeting small interfering RNA (50 and 100 nM) (P < 0.05). The small interfering RNA effectively silenced herpes simplex virus type 1 infected‐cell polypeptide 4 expression on both mRNA and the protein levels (P < 0.05). The inhibition of infected‐cell polypeptide 4‐targeting small interfering RNA on infected‐cell polypeptide 4 protein expression was also verified by Western blot in herpes simplex virus type 1 infected human cornea epithelial cell, human trabecular meshwork cells and Vero cells. Conclusions:  Infected‐cell polypeptide 4‐targeting small interfering RNA can inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 replication in retina epithelial cells, providing a foundation for development of RNA interference as an antiviral therapy.","ophthalmology"
"Miniaturized analytical systems, especially microchip CE (MCE), are becoming a promising tool for analytical purposes including DNA analysis. These microdevices require a sensitive and miniaturizable detection system such as electrochemical detection (ED). Several electroactive DNA intercalators, including the organic dye methylene blue (MB), anthraquinone derivatives, and the metal complexes Fe(phen)32+ and Ru(phen)32+, have been tested for using in combination with thermoplastic olefin polymer of amorphous structure (Topas) CE‐microchips and ED. Two end‐channel approaches for integration of gold wire electrodes in CE‐ED microchip were used. A 250 μm diameter gold wire was manually aligned at the outlet of the separation channel. A new approach based on a guide channel for integration of 100 and 50 μm diameter gold wire has been also developed in order to reduce the background current and the baseline noise level. Modification of gold wire electrodes has been also tested to improve the detector performance. Application of MCE‐ED for ssDNA detection has been studied and demonstrated for the first time using the electroactive dye MB. Electrostatic interaction between cationic MB and anionic ssDNA was used for monitoring the DNA on microchips. Thus, reproducible calibration curves for ssDNA were obtained. This study advances the feasibility of direct DNA analysis using CE‐microchip with ED.","chemistry"
"In fewer than four months in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread from China to 25 countries and Taiwan, becoming the first new, easily transmissible infectious disease of the twenty‐first century. The role of air transport in the diffusion of the disease became obvious early in the crisis; to assess that role more carefully, this study relates the spatial‐temporal pattern of the SARS outbreak to a measure of airline network accessibility. Specifically, the accessibility from those countries that were infected by SARS, beginning with China, to other countries was measured using airline schedules. The country‐pair accessibility measure, along with other country‐level factors relevant to the disease, were tested as determinants of the speed with which SARS arrived in infected countries as well as its failure to arrive in most countries. The analyses indicate that airline network accessibility was an especially influential variable but also that the importance of this variable diminished in the latter weeks of the outbreak. The latter finding is partly attributable to public health measures, particularly health screening in airports. The timing and geography of those measures are reviewed using data from media reports and interim World Health Organization (WHO) documents during the outbreak. The uneven effort to curtail the international diffusion of SARS suggests further planning is needed to develop a concerted response to contain future epidemics.","geography"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route. A distinct coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS‐CoV. Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS‐CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.

"Over a century since its development, the analytical technique of mass spectrometry is blooming more than ever, and applied in nearly all aspects of the natural and life sciences. In the last two decades mass spectrometry has also become amenable to the analysis of proteins and even intact protein complexes, and thus begun to make a significant impact in the field of structural biology. In this Review, we describe the emerging role of mass spectrometry, with its different technical facets, in structural biology, focusing especially on structural virology. We describe how mass spectrometry has evolved into a tool that can provide unique structural and functional information about viral‐protein and protein‐complex structure, conformation, assembly, and topology, extending to the direct analysis of intact virus capsids of several million Dalton in mass. Mass spectrometry is now used to address important questions in virology ranging from how viruses assemble to how they interact with their host.","chemistry"
"Viruses from the Filoviridae family, as many other virus families, require an acidic pH for successful infection and are therefore susceptible to the actions of 4‐aminoquinolines, such as chloroquine. Although the mechanisms of action of chloroquine clearly indicate that it might inhibit filoviral infections, several clinical trials that attempted to use chloroquine in the treatment of other acute viral infections – including dengue and influenza A and B – caused by low pH‐dependent viruses, have reported that chloroquine had no clinical efficacy, and these results demoted chloroquine from the potential treatments for other virus families requiring low pH for infectivity. The present review is aimed at investigating whether chloroquine could combat the present Ebola virus epidemic, and also at exploring the main reasons for the reported lack of efficacy. Literature was sourced from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, reference list of articles and textbooks – Fields Virology (Volumes 1and 2), the cytokine handbook, Pharmacology in Medicine: Principles and Practice, and hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy. The present analysis concludes that (1) chloroquine might find a place in the treatment of Ebola, either as a monotherapy or in combination therapies; (2) the ineffectiveness of chloroquine, or its analogue, hydroxychloroquine, at treating infections from low pH‐dependent viruses is a result of the failure to attain and sustain a steady state concentration sufficient to increase and keep the pH of the acidic organelles to approximately neutral levels; (3) to successfully treat filoviral infections – or other viral infections that emerge or emerged from low pH‐dependent viruses – a steady state chloroquine plasma concentration of at least 1 µg/mL(~3.125 μM/L) or a whole blood concentration of 16 μM/L must be achieved and be sustained until the patients' viraemia becomes undetectable. These concentrations, however, do not rule out the efficacy of other, higher, steady state concentrations – although such concentrations might be accompanied by severe adverse effects or toxicities. The feasibility of the conclusion in the preceding texts has recently been supported by a subsequent study that shows that amodiaquine, a derivative of CQ, is able to protect humans infected with Ebola from death.","cell"
"Recent findings demonstrate that priming by levamisole of weaned pigs experimentally vaccinated against postweaning colibacillosis (PWC) contributes to immune protection from challenge‐induced clinical disease through stimulation of the mesenteric lymph node cells that participate in cell‐mediated immunity. With the objective of better understanding the mechanisms by which levamisole induces protective mucosal cell‐mediated immune response to vaccination against PWC, it was tested whether the drug synergizes experimental F4ac+ Escherichia coli oral vaccine in stimulating T cells also in the jejunal lamina propria (JLP) and ileal Peyer's patch (IPP) upon virulent challenge. Commercial crossbred pigs weaned at 4 weeks were allocated into two equal groups. The experimental group was i.m. primed with levamisole at an immunostimulatory dose of 2.5 mg/kg once daily, for 3 consecutive days, and controls received saline. Both groups were vaccinated orally with the vaccinal E. coli strain on day 0 and challenged with the virulent E. coli strain 7 days later. All pigs were killed on postchallenge day 6. The results determined by immunophenotyping of isolated cells indicate that priming by levamisole of the vaccinated weaned pigs selectively recruited and activated T cells in the IPP, a lymphoid organ‐generating B lymphocytes. The pig IPP is normally populated with up to 5% of CD3+ T cells and CD6 is an activation antigen expressed exclusively by T cells in swine. Therefore, a significantly higher number of CD3+ (P < 0.01) and CD6+ (P < 0.001) cells observed within the IPP follicles of the primed‐vaccinated vs. unprimed‐vaccinated challenge‐infected pigs suggest enhanced T cell‐mediated immunity in this B‐cell compartment induced by the potentiating action of the drug and vaccine. The ability of levamisole to influence interaction between activated T cells and B cells in the IPP of primed‐vaccinated weaned pigs, and the possibility that this interaction plays a role in regulating B‐cell maturation within the IPP follicles, are discussed.","veterinary"
"A new Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) is the aetiological agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Because of the critical role played by serological assays for SARS diagnosis, an in‐house ELISA based on SARS‐CoV recombinant antigens was developed. The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid protein (N), three N fragments (N1, N2, and N3) and the intraviral domain of the membrane protein (M2) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine‐tagged proteins. Six reference sera from SARS patients were used to detect virus‐specific IgG in an ELISA using each recombinant protein as coating antigen. High‐titre positive reactions were detected in all SARS positive sera. The specificity of the assay appears to be high as no positive reaction was detected in the sera of 20 healthy subjects and 73 patients with non‐SARS, low‐tract respiratory infections. Specific hyper‐immune sera to SARS‐CoV and the recombinant proteins, N, N1, N2, N3, and M2 were also generated in mice and rabbits. The specificity of these sera was confirmed by an immunocytochemical assay on biochips of SARS‐CoV infected and uninfected cells. J. Med. Virol. 76:137–142, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"The aetiological agent of an emergent outbreak of atypical pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is a positive‐stranded RNA virus (SARS‐CoV) belonging to the Coronaviridae family with a genome that differs substantially from those of other known coronaviruses. Highly conserved heptad‐repeat (HR1 and HR2) regions in class I viral fusion proteins, including spike protein from SARS coronavirus, interact with each other to form a six‐helix bundle, which is called a fusion core. The crystal structure of the fusion core is expected to greatly facilitate drug design. Crystals of the fusion core of SARS‐CoV spike protein have been grown at 291 K using PEG 4000 as precipitant. The diffraction pattern of the crystal extends to 2.8 Å resolution at 100 K in‐house.

"An outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong in late February 2003, resulting in 8,096 cumulative cases with 774 deaths. The outbreak was amplified by nosocomial transmission in many hospitals. Using mathematical modeling, we simulated the number of new incident and prevalent cases of SARS after one infected person was admitted to a hospital (index case). The simulation was tested stochastically using the SEIR model based on previously reported Gamma distributions. We estimated the duration time until 10 beds in negative pressure rooms in Chiyoda‐ku, one of the 23 wards in Tokyo, were fully occupied with SARS‐infected patients. We determined the impact of an increasing number of days on the number of prevalent cases until the index case was isolated. The prevalent cases increase exponentially along with the increase of the non‐isolation period of the index case, and all the beds were fully occupied if the index case was not isolated until more than 6 days. However even 2 days non‐isolation period of the index case could fill up all the beds when 16% of secondary infections are transmitted outside the hospital. There is a possibility that an epidemic will occur with the isolation of the index case even at early days if the infection is transmitted outside the hospital. The simulation results revealed that it was important to recognize and isolate SARS patients as early as possible and also to prevent the transmission spreading outside the hospital to control an epidemic.","microbiology"

"A highly sensitive and selective LC‐ESI‐MS was developed, validated for the simultaneous determination of 18α‐glycyrrhetic acid (α‐GA) and 18β‐glycyrrhetic acid (β‐GA) for pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects. Sample preparation was performed by liquid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and the separations were achieved using a C18 column with the mobile phase composed of 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate solution–methanol–acetonitrile (40:36:24, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The internal standard was honokiol and the epimers were quantified using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer employing ESI in the negative ion mode. The separation factor, α, was 1.512 for α‐ and β‐GA. The standard curves were linear for both epimers with coefficients of determination (r ≥ 0.9998) over the concentration range of 1–150 ng/mL. The precision and accuracy were ≤ 4.33 and ≤ 6.57%, respectively. The mean plasma extraction recoveries were 82.23 ± 1.91 and 84.29 ± 2.09% for α‐GA and β‐GA, respectively. The assay was successfully applied to evaluation of the pharmacokinetic properties of α‐GA and β‐GA from 19 volunteers who had received oral administration of diammonium glycyrrhizinate capsules. The initial data suggest that glycyrrhizin metabolizes to glycyrrhetic acid fairly slowly and the elimination of α‐GA is slower than that of β‐GA.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious disease with a significant morbidity and case fatality. The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache and dyspnoea. Less common symptoms include sputum production, sore throat, coryza, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Older subjects may present with decrease in general well‐being, poor feeding, fall/fracture and delirium, without the typical febrile response. Common laboratory features include lymphopenia with depletion of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, elevated D‐Dimer, elevated alanine transminases, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase. The constellation of compatible clinical and laboratory findings, together with the rather characteristic radiological features especially on HRCT and the lack of clinical response to broad‐spectrum antibiotics, should quickly arouse suspicion of SARS.

"The pharmacotherapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is controversial and largely anecdotal. Most patients with suspected SARS should initially be treated with potent antibiotics before proceeding to ‘anti‐SARS’ therapy. There is a spectrum of severity and rate of progression in SARS, and the stages of viral replication, inflammatory pneumonitis and residual pulmonary fibrosis are clinically non‐distinct. Although now considered lacking in efficacy, ribavirin was used extensively in Hong Kong for treatment of SARS. Retrospective data suggest that the use of Kaletra (ritonavir and lopinavir), an anti‐protease, could reduce mortality and improve outcomes, although the adverse reactions are also worrisome. Anecdotal experience strongly supports the use of steroid, at least in a subset of SARS patients, particularly with ‘critical SARS’ who display continued clinical instability or deterioration and progressive radiographic or HRCT deterioration. A retrospective study carried out of 72 probable SARS patients has shown that cases who received pulse methylprendisolone did not differ in cumulative steroid dosage or adverse reactions, although the former patients had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood of requiring rescue pulse steroid therapy than their counterparts. Nevertheless, lower dosage of steroid as initial therapy in SARS had also been associated with good clinical outcomes. Poor responders to initial therapy might benefit from rescue steroid therapy or intravenous Pentaglobin. Other drug treatments had also been tried in desperate patients, including the use of convalescence serum and plasmapheresis. Secondary infections could be troublesome, particular for patients with prolonged hospitalization and mechanical ventilation.","respiratory"

"Spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) is a rhabdovirus associated with systemic illness and mortality in cyprinids. Several diagnostic tests are available for detection of SVCV. However, most of these tests are time consuming and are not well adapted for field‐based diagnostics. In this study, a diagnostic tool for SVCV detection based on reverse transcription loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (RT‐LAMP) has been developed. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein (G) gene of SVCV North Carolina (NC) isolate, four sets (each set containing two outer and two inner) of primers were designed. Temperature and time conditions were optimized to 65 °C and 60 min, respectively, for LAMP and RT‐LAMP using one primer set. In vitro specificity was evaluated using four different strains of fish rhabdoviruses and RT‐LAMP was found to be specific to SVCV. Serial dilutions of SVCV NC isolate was used to evaluate the in vitro sensitivity of RT‐LAMP. Sensitivity of the assays was similar to RT‐PCR and detected SVCV even at the lowest dilution of 101 TCID50 mL−1. The ability of RT‐LAMP to detect SVCV from infected carp was also tested and the assay detected SVCV from all infected fish. The isothermal temperature requirements, high specificity and sensitivity, and short incubation time of the RT‐LAMP assay make it an excellent choice as a field diagnostic test for SVCV.","veterinary"
"Viruses are the most important cause of infections and a major source of mortality in Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTRs). These patients may acquire viral infections through exogenous routes including community exposure, donor organs, and blood products or by endogenous reactivation of latent viruses. Beside major opportunistic infections due to CMV and EBV and viral hepatitis B and C, several viral diseases have recently emerged in KTRs. New medical practices or technologies, implementation of new diagnostic tools, and improved medical information have contributed to the emergence of these viral diseases in this special population. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on emerging viral diseases and newly discovered viruses in KTRs over the last two decades. We identified viruses in the field of KT that had shown the greatest increase in numbers of citations in the NCBI PubMed database. BKV was the most cited in the literature and linked to an emerging disease that represents a great clinical concern in KTRs. HHV‐8, PVB19, WNV, JCV, H1N1 influenza virus A, HEV, and GB virus were the main other emerging viruses. Excluding HHV8, newly discovered viruses have been infrequently linked to clinical diseases in KTRs. Nonetheless, pathogenicity can emerge long after the discovery of the causative agent, as has been the case for BKV. Overall, antiviral treatments are very limited, and reducing immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of management. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","virology"
"The last few decades have been marked by a rapid expansion in the world?s population, along with an increasingly dynamic mobility of individuals. This accelerated global inter‐connectedness enabled microorganisms to reach virtually any location worldwide more rapidly and efficiently than ever before, reshaping the global dynamics of pathogens. As a result, a local infectious disease outbreak anywhere in the world may almost instantaneously assume global dimensions, and should therefore be considered a global priority. The history of several infectious diseases illustrates that in addition to prophylactic and therapeutic medical interventions, the interplay of social, economic, and political factors makes a fundamental contribution to the outcome of infectious disease outbreaks. Furthermore, this multi‐ and cross‐disciplinary interconnectedness is a key determinant of the outcome of efforts to eradicate vaccine‐preventable infectious diseases. A combined framework that incorporates teachings provided by previous outbreaks, and integrates medical and biomedical interventions with contributions made by social, economic, and political factors, emerges as vital requirement of successful global public health initiatives.","medicine"

Since its approval in 2006, the science of discovering and developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies derived from the XenoMouse® platform has advanced considerably. The emerging array of antibody therapeutics developed using transgenic technologies is expected to include antibodies and antibody fragments with novel mechanisms of action and extreme potencies. In addition to these impressive functional properties, these antibodies will be designed to have superior biophysical properties that enable highly efficient large‐scale manufacturing methods. Achieving these new heights in antibody drug discovery will ultimately bring better medicines to patients. Here, we review best practices for the discovery and bio‐optimization of monoclonal antibodies that fit functional design goals and meet high manufacturing standards.","immunology"
"There is a profound need for the scientific community to be better aware of the policy context in which it operates. To address this need, Evolution has established a new Outlook feature section to include papers that explore the interface between society and evolutionary biology. This first paper in the series considers the strategic relevance of evolutionary biology. Support for scientific research in general is based on governmental or institutional expenditure that is an investment, and such investment is based on strategies designed to achieve particular outcomes, such as advance in particular areas of basic science or application. The scientific community can engage in the development of scientific strategies on a variety of levels, including workshops to explicitly develop research priorities and targeted funding initiatives to help define emerging scientific areas. Better understanding and communication of the scientific achievements of evolutionary biology, emphasizing immediate and potential societal relevance, are effective counters to challenges presented by the creationist agenda. Future papers in the Outlook feature section should assist the evolutionary biology community in achieving a better collective understanding of the societal relevance of their field.","genetics"

"Background and Aims: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a common childhood pathogen associated with atypical pneumonia (AP). It is often a mild disease and seldom results in paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission. In 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) coined the word SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in patients with severe acute respiratory symptoms (sars) for an outbreak of AP in Hong Kong due to a novel coronavirus. In 2012, another outbreak of coronavirus AP occurred in the Middle East. Confusing case definitions such as MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) were coined. This paper aims to present a case of MP with sars, ARDS, pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and review the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP. Methods: We presented a case of MP with sars, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and pleural effusion during the MERS epidemics, and performed a literature review on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care. Results: In early 2013, an 11‐year‐old girl presented with sars, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), right‐sided pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was treated with multiple antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae was not isolated in this girl with ‘typical’ pneumonia by symptomatology and chest radiography, but tracheal aspirate identified MP instead. The respiratory equations are computed with PaO2/FiO2 consistent with severe lung injury. Literature on the incidence and mortality of severe AP with MP requiring PICU care is reviewed. Six, 165 and 293 articles were found when PubMed (a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine) was searched for the terms ‘mycoplasma’ and ‘ICU’, ‘mycoplasma’ and ‘mortality’, and ‘mycoplasma' and ‘severe’. Mortality and PICU admission associated with MP is general low and rarely reported. Experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of lung injuries in MP infection is associated with a cell‐mediated immune reaction, and high responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy has been reported especially for severe disease. Management of severe mycoplasma infection in the PICU includes general cardiopulmonary support and specific antimicrobial treatment. Macrolide resistance genotypes have been detected. Conclusion: We urge health organizations to refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions each and every time when outbreaks of AP occur.","respiratory"
"In the context of airborne infection control, it is critical that the ventilation system is able to extract the contaminated exhaled air within the shortest possible time. To minimize the spread of contaminated air exhaled by occupants efficiently, a novel personalized ventilation (PV)–personalized exhaust (PE) system has been developed, which aims to exhaust the exhaled air as much as possible from around the infected person (IP). The PV–PE system was studied experimentally for a particular healthcare setting based on a typical consultation room geometry and four different medical consultation positions of an IP and a healthy person (HP). Experiments using two types of tracer gases were conducted to evaluate two types of PE: Top‐PE and Shoulder‐PE under two different background ventilation systems: Mixing Ventilation and Displacement Ventilation. Personalized exposure effectiveness, intake fraction (iF) and exposure reduction (ε) were used as indices to evaluate the PV–PE system. The results show that the combined PV‐PE system for the HP achieves the lowest intake fraction; and the use of PE system for the IP alone shows much better performance than using PV system for the HP alone.","public"
"Abstract  There has been a rapid growth of scientific literature on the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the research of ventilation and indoor air science. With a 1000–10,000 times increase in computer hardware capability in the past 20 years, CFD has become an integral part of scientific research and engineering development of complex air distribution and ventilation systems in buildings. This review discusses the major and specific challenges of CFD in terms of turbulence modelling, numerical approximation, and boundary conditions relevant to building ventilation. We emphasize the growing need for CFD verification and validation, suggest ongoing needs for analytical and experimental methods to support the numerical solutions, and discuss the growing capacity of CFD in opening up new research areas. We suggest that CFD has not become a replacement for experiment and theoretical analysis in ventilation research, rather it has become an increasingly important partner. Practical Implications: We believe that an effective scientific approach for ventilation studies is still to combine experiments, theory, and CFD. We argue that CFD verification and validation are becoming more crucial than ever as more complex ventilation problems are solved. It is anticipated that ventilation problems at the city scale will be tackled by CFD in the next 10 years.","public"
"A quantitative model is developed to predict the Km of 47 human dopamine sulfotransferases by gene expression programming. Each kind of compound is represented by several calculated structural descriptors of moment of inertia A, average electrophilic reactivity index for a C atom, relative number of triple bonds, RNCG relative negative charge, HA‐dependent HDSA‐1, and HBCA H‐bonding charged surface area. Eight fitness functions of the gene expression programming method are used to find the best nonlinear model. The best quantitative model with squared standard error and square of correlation coefficient are 0.096 and 0.91 for training data set, and 0.102 and 0.88 for test set, respectively. It is shown that the gene expression programming‐predicted results with fitness function are in good agreement with experimental ones.","chemistry"
"The authors have previously shown that acute lung injury (ALI) produces a wide spectrum of pathological processes in patients who die of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and that the SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) nucleoprotein is detectable in the lungs, and other organs and tissues, in these patients. In the present study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays were used to analyse the expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS‐CoV spike (S) protein, and some pro‐inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including MCP‐1, TGF‐β1, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of SARS. SARS‐CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2‐expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS‐CoV infection in vivo in humans. High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS‐CoV‐infected ACE2+ cells, but not in the uninfected cells. These results suggest that cells infected by SARS‐CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno‐mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi‐organ dysfunction. Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS. Copyright © 2006 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

"Air‐space disease is typical in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and may be indistinguishable from pneumonia of other causes. In the majority of patients, ground glass opacities on chest radiographs progress rapidly to focal, multifocal or diffuse consolidation. Unilateral involvement is common in the early acute phase, becoming bilateral at maximal lung involvement. Generally, radiographic opacities peak between 8 and 10 days after onset of illness, with radiographic scores reflecting temporal changes in clinical and laboratory parameters such as oxygen saturation (SaO2) and liver transaminases. Pleural effusions, cavitating consolidation and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are not typical radiographic features. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces are complications that are associated with extensive disease, with or without assisted ventilation. The utility of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and CT scans lies in the confirmation of airspace opacities in cases with normal initial chest radiographs that have strong contact history and signs and symptoms highly suspicious of SARS during the outbreak, allowing early treatment and prompt isolation. The characteristic HRCT feature in the acute phase is ground‐glass opacities with smooth interlobular septal thickening, sometimes with consolidation in a subpleural location, which progress rapidly to involve other areas of the lungs. Temporal lung changes documented on HRCT suggest that some residual opacities found may not be reversible.","respiratory"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus. It is characterised by a highly infectious syndrome of fever and respiratory symptoms, and is usually associated with bilateral lung infiltrates. The clinical syndrome of SARS often progresses to varying degrees of respiratory failure, with about 20% of patients requiring intensive care. Despite concern about potential aerosol generation, non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) has been reported to be efficacious in the treatment of SARS‐related ARF without posing infection risks to health care workers (HCW). Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in SARS is common. The incidence of NIV‐associated barotrauma ranged from 6.6% to 15%. Patients who fail to tolerate NIV or fail NIV with progressive dyspnoea, tachypnoea and hypoxaemia should be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Mortality rates in intensive care units for SARS patients were high: 34–53% at 28 days, when some patients were still being ventilated. Strict adherence to infection control measures including isolation, use of appropriate personal protective equipment and negative pressure environment had been reported to eliminate cross‐infection to HCW.","respiratory"
"The aim of the study was to establish the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS CoV) in host cells and determine the pathogenesis of SARS. Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were inoculated with SARS coronavirus for 3, 7, 24, 48, and 72 hr, respectively, and were observed under electron microscope. It was found that the SARS coronavirus entered the cells through membrane fusion instead of endocytosis, and then the nucleocapsids assembled in the RER and matured by budding into the smooth vesicles, which were derived from the Golgi apparatus. The smooth vesicles fused with the cell membrane, and the mature particles were released. A special phenomenon was that some virus‐like particles appeared in the nucleus. We propose a scheme of the life cycle of SARS coronavirus and discuss the mechanism of its replication in Vero E6 cells. J. Med. Virol. 73:332–337, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐CoV is a newly emerging virus that causes SARS with high mortality rate in infected people. To study the humoral responses against SARS‐CoV, we evaluated nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins‐specific antibodies in patients' sera by Western blotting and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Recombinant N and S proteins of SARS‐CoV were purified from transformed E. coli. Serum specimens from 40 SARS‐CoV‐infected patients in the convalescent phase were analyzed by Western blotting using the purified antigens. Serial serum specimens from 12 RT‐PCR‐confirmed SARS patients were assayed by ELISA using the recombinant N protein as coated antigen. By Western blotting, 97.5% of the SARS patients were positive for N protein‐specific antibodies whereas only 47.5% of the samples were positive for S protein‐specific antibodies. Using N protein‐based ELISA, 10 out of the 12 patients were positive for N protein‐specific antibodies and 6 of them showed seroconversion at mean of 16 days after onset of fever. Immunoblotting was useful for detecting the humoral immune response after SARS‐CoV infection. Antibodies against SARS‐CoV N protein appear at the early stage of infection, therefore, N protein‐based ELISA could serve as a simple, sensitive, and specific test for diagnosing SARS‐CoV infection.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) can produce gastrointestinal symptoms. The intestinal tract is the only extrapulmonary site where viable viruses have been detected. This study examined seven established human intestinal cell lines, DLD‐1, HCT‐116, HT‐29, LoVo, LS‐180, SW‐480 and SW‐620, for their permissiveness to SARS‐CoV infection. The results showed that only LoVo cells were permissive to SARS‐CoV infection as evident by positive findings from indirect immunofluorescence staining for intracellular viral antigens, in situ hybridization for intracellular viral RNA, and electron microscopy for intracellular viral particles. In contrast to Vero cells, SARS‐CoV did not produce cytopathic effects on LoVo cells. However, LoVo cells were found to be highly permissive for productive infection with a high viral titre (>3 × 107 viral copies/ml) produced in culture supernatant following a few days of incubation. SARS‐CoV established a stable persistent chronic infection that could be maintained after multiple passages. Being a cell line of human origin, LoVo cells could be a useful in vitro model for studying the biology and persistent infection of SARS‐CoV. Our results on the expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a recently identified cellular receptor for SARS‐CoV, in these cell lines indicated that it might not be the sole determinant for cells to be susceptible to SARS‐CoV infection.

"The importance of rapid diagnosis of influenza has increased with the availability of neuraminidase inhibitors, which need to be commenced within 48 hr of symptom onset. Furthermore, the recent development of influenza‐like clinical syndromes with novel aetiologies (severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS) has increased the need for rapid and accurate near‐patient diagnosis. A new, modified point of care (POC) diagnostic test (ZstatFlu) was assessed on 469 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and 260 nose/throat swabs (TS) taken from children and adults. The test was specific (77–98%) for all specimen types for influenza virus A and B, depending upon incubation conditions. However, it was less sensitive, detecting 65–77% of specimens confirmed as positive on culture, direct immunofluorescence or PCR testing. A positive test is useful, for both directing initiation of therapy in the clinician's office, and making a positive diagnosis of influenza in patients with influenza‐like clinical syndromes. J. Med.

"The origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) remains unclear. Evidence based on Bayesian scanning plots and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods indicates that SARS‐CoV, for the largest part of the genome (∼80%), is more closely related to Group II coronaviruses sequences, whereas in three regions in the ORF1ab gene it shows no apparent similarity to any of the previously characterized groups of coronaviruses. There is discordant phylogenetic clustering of SARS‐CoV and coronaviruses sequences, throughout the genome, compatible with either ancient recombination events or altered evolutionary rates in different lineages, or a combination of both.

"Background: To present preparedness planning for an influenza pandemic for two nursing subunits: nursing services in hospitals and schools of nursing in universities. Discussion: The preparedness plan is modeled on a modified Haddon matrix, a logical approach to identify measures appropriate for the pre‐event, event, and postevent phases of an influenza pandemic. For the pre‐event phase, the objective is to ensure preparedness for the potential pandemic outbreak through training, communication, surveillance, infection control, and vaccination. Once the pandemic outbreak is declared, the aim is to implement effective measures to ensure a rapid and appropriate response. For the postevent phase, the plan is focused on the restoration of core functions, vigilance for a second or possibly more waves of the pandemic, and psychosocial support to staff and students. Conclusion: Measures required to prepare for, respond to, and manage the consequences of influenza pandemic are identified. This planning indicates the need to balance a logical approach with contextual perspectives and the importance for nursing leaders to develop plans for subunits of larger entities.","nursing"
"Epistatic interactions between mutations are widespread. Theoretical investigations have shown that variability in epistatic effects influences fundamental evolutionary processes, yet few empirical studies have identified causes or the extent of this variation. We examined variation in epistatic effects of mutations at two host recognition sites in φX174 bacteriophage. We calculated epistatic effects from the sum of fitness effects (log scale) of two single mutants and their corresponding double mutant for five combinations of mutations in six conditions. We found that epistatic effects differed in sign, degree, and variability across conditions. The data highlight that even between single mutations at the same two sites the sign and variability of epistatic effects are affected by environment. We discuss these findings in the context of studying the role of epistasis in evolution.","genetics"
"Emerging viral infections are becoming a serious problem in Europe in the recent years. This is particularly true for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus (WNV) disease, Toscana virus (TOSV) disease, and potentially for avian influenza virus (H5N1). In contrast, emergence or re‐emergence of severe viral infections, including tick borne encephalitis virus, and viral haemorrhagic fever caused by Hantavirus and dengue virus have been frequently reported in several European countries. Laboratory diagnosis of these viral infections based on viral isolation or detection by immune electron microscopy, immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has dramatically improved in the recent years, and SARS represents a good example of a diagnostic approach to emerging viral infections. Finally, old and new promising agents are in the pipeline of pharmaceutical companies to treat emerging viral infections. However only prevention based on large epidemiological studies, and research and development of new vaccines may be able to control and eventually eradicate these deadly viral infections.

"The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) mediates the first essential step in the viral life cycle, virus entry into target cells. Influenza virus HA is synthesised as a precursor protein in infected cells and requires cleavage by host cell proteases to transit into an active form. Cleavage is essential for influenza virus infectivity and the HA‐processing proteases are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. It is well established that cleavage by ubiquitously expressed subtilisin‐like proteases is a hallmark of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV). In contrast, the nature of the proteases responsible for cleavage of HA of human influenza viruses and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) is not well understood. Recent studies suggest that cleavage of HA of human influenza viruses might be a cell‐associated event and might be facilitated by the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and human airway trypsin‐like protease (HAT). Here, we will introduce the different concepts established for proteolytic activation of influenza virus HA, with a particular focus on the role of TTSPs, and we will discuss their implications for viral tropism, pathogenicity and antiviral intervention.

"The type I interferon (IFN) response is a strong and crucial moderator for the control of viral infections. The strength of this system is illustrated by the fact that, despite some temporary discomfort like a common cold or diarrhea, most viral infections will not cause major harm to the healthy immunocompetent host. To achieve this, the immune system is equipped with a wide array of pattern recognition receptors and the subsequent coordinated type I IFN response orchestrated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). The production of type I IFN subtypes by dendritic cells (DCs), but also other cells is crucial for the execution of many antiviral processes. Despite this coordinated response, morbidity and mortality are still common in viral disease due to the ability of viruses to exploit the weaknesses of the immune system. Viruses successfully evade immunity and infection can result in aberrant immune responses. However, these weaknesses also open opportunities for improvement via clinical interventions as can be seen in current vaccination and antiviral treatment programs. The application of IFNs, Toll‐like receptor ligands, DCs, and antiviral proteins is now being investigated to further limit viral infections. Unfortunately, a common threat during stimulation of immunity is the possible initiation or aggravation of autoimmunity. Also the translation from animal models to the human situation remains difficult. With a Strengths–Weaknesses–Opportunities–Threats (“SWOT”) analysis, we discuss the interaction between host and virus as well as (future) therapeutic options, related to the type I IFN system.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in Southern China in November 2002, and was brought to Hong Kong in February 2003. From Hong Kong, the disease spread rapidly worldwide but mostly to Asian countries. At the end of the epidemic in June, the global cumulative total was 8422 cases with 916 deaths (case fatality rate of 11%). People of all ages were affected, but predominantly females. Health care workers were at high risk and accounted for one‐fifth of all cases. Risk factors for death included old age and comorbid illnesses, especially diabetes. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is transmitted by droplets or direct inoculation from contact with infected surfaces. Contaminated sewage was found to be responsible for the outbreak in a housing estate in Hong Kong affecting over 300 residents. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2–10). The duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was from 3 to 5 days. The relatively prolonged incubation period allowed asymptomatic air travellers to spread the disease globally. The number of individuals infected by each case has been estimated to be 2.7. Effective control of nosocomial transmission included early detection of disease, strict isolation of patients, practice of droplet and contact precautions and compliance with the use of personal protective equipment. Effective control of disease spread in the community included tracing and quarantine of contacts. Development of a validated diagnostic test and an effective vaccine as well as elimination of possible animal reservoirs are measures needed to prevent another epidemic.","respiratory"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in the acute phase. Worldwide case fatality rate is 11% (range 7 to 27%) for the most severely affected regions. Several adverse prognostic factors have been identified, including advanced age, presence of comorbidity, higher lactose dehydrogenase levels and initial neutrophil count, but the impact of viral and other host factors on outcome is unknown. Published data on sequelae of SARS are limited. Clinical follow‐up of patients who recovered from SARS has demonstrated radiological, functional and psychological abnormalities of varying degrees. In the early rehabilitation phase, many complained of limitations in physical function from general weakness and/or shortness of breath. In a small series of subjects who underwent CT scan of the chest, over half showed some patchy changes consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Lung function testing at 6–8 weeks after hospital discharge showed mild or moderate restrictive pattern consistent with muscle weakness in 6–20% of subjects. Mild decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was detected in a minority of subjects. Preliminary evidence suggests that these lung function abnormalities will improve over time. Psychobehavioural problems of anxiety and/or depression were not uncommon in the early recovery phase, and improved over time in the majority of patients. Avascular necrosis of the hip has been reported as another complication. The long‐term sequelae of SARS are still largely unknown. It is important to follow up these patients to detect and appropriately manage any persistent or emerging long‐term sequelae in the physical, psychological and social domains.","respiratory"

This and related methods are increasingly being used to search for the causes of diseases of presumed infectious aetiology, but for which no agent has yet been found. Other methods that do not require prior knowledge of the genome sequence of any virus that may be present in the patient specimen include whole genome amplification, random PCR and subtractive hybridisation and differential display.

"Coronaviruses are a family of positive‐stranded RNA viruses that includes important pathogens of humans and other animals. The large coronavirus genome (26–31 kb) encodes 15–16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are derived from two replicase polyproteins by autoproteolytic processing. The nsps assemble into the viral replication–transcription complex and nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are believed to anchor this enzyme complex to modified intracellular membranes. The largest part of the coronavirus nsp4 subunit is hydrophobic and is predicted to be embedded in the membranes. In this report, a conserved C‐terminal domain (∼100 amino‐acid residues) has been delineated that is predicted to face the cytoplasm and has been isolated as a soluble domain using library‐based construct screening. A prototypical crystal structure at 2.8 Å resolution was obtained using nsp4 from feline coronavirus. Unmodified and SeMet‐substituted proteins were crystallized under similar conditions, resulting in tetragonal crystals that belonged to space group P43. The phase problem was initially solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS), followed by molecular replacement using a SIRAS‐derived composite model. The structure consists of a single domain with a predominantly α‐helical content displaying a unique fold that could be engaged in protein–protein interactions.","crystallography"

"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is the first major novel infectious disease to hit the international community in the 21st century. It originated in southern China in November 2002, reached Hong Kong in February 2003 and spread rapidly thereafter to 29 countries/regions on five continents. At the end of the epidemic, the global cumulative total was 8098 with 774 deaths. Seven Asian countries/regions were among the top ten on the list. Mainland China and Hong Kong, SAR, accounted for 87% of all cases and 84% of all deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is caused by a novel coronavirus. It has alarmed the world with its infectivity and significant morbidity and mortality, its lack of a rapid, reliable diagnostic test and lack of effective specific treatment and vaccination. The adverse impact on travel and business around the world, particularly in Asia, has been enormous. Some lessons learnt from this epidemic included: (1) any outbreak of infectious disease can rapidly spread around the world by air travel; (2) early reporting of the outbreak to neighbouring countries/regions and the World Health Organization is essential to prevent international spread; and (3) infection control, tracing and quarantine of contacts are essential to control the epidemic. Many questions remain unanswered, including the origin and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, the natural history and the best specific treatment of the disease. The SARS‐CoV has probably jumped from an animal host to humans. There is an urgent need to evaluate the human–animal habitat in southern China and to remove animal reservoirs if found.","respiratory"
"Nosocomial clustering with transmission to health care workers, patients and visitors is a prominent feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Hospital outbreaks of SARS typically occurred within the first week after admission of the very first SARS cases when the disease was not recognized and before isolation measures were implemented. In the majority of nosocomial infections, there was a history of close contact with a SARS patient, and transmission occurred via large droplets, direct contact with infectious material or by contact with fomites contaminated by infectious material. In a few instances, potential airborne transmission was reported in association with endotracheal intubation, nebulised medications and non‐invasive positive pressure ventilation of SARS patients. In all SARS‐affected countries, nosocomial transmission of the disease was effectively halted by enforcement of routine standard, contact and droplet precautions in all clinical areas and additional airborne precautions in the high‐risk areas. In Hong Kong, where there are few private rooms for patient isolation, some hospitals have obtained good outcome by having designated SARS teams and separate wards for patient triage, confirmed SARS cases and step‐down of patients in whom SARS had been ruled out. In conclusion, SARS represents one of the new challenges for those who are involved in hospital infection control. As SARS might re‐emerge, all hospitals should take advantage of the current SARS‐free interval to review their infection control programmes, alert mechanisms, response capability and to repair any identified inadequacies.","respiratory"
"As there are no validated and rapid diagnostic tests nor specific treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the initial stage of the outbreak, public health measures are vital for the control of the disease. These included an enhanced disease surveillance system, expanded laboratory diagnostic capacity, heightened infection control in hospitals and residential institutions for the elderly, intensive contact tracing coupled with medical surveillance at designated medical centres, quarantine of close contacts by way of home confinement, formation of multidisciplinary investigation and response teams, and public education and communication. The above measures were implemented in many countries during the outbreak. To prevent spread in the region and beyond, port health measures targeted at both entry and exit health screenings were also carried out together with regional and international liaison.","respiratory"
"Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is responsible for enteric disease in pups. Infected dogs generally have a rapid recovery, so the virus is highly contagious and the spread of infection is difficult to control. Chemical disinfectants have been widely used in human disease‐control programmes to prevent viral infectious diseases from spreading, but to date, there are no studies in the literature on the sensitivity of CCoV to chemical biocides. The present study investigated the sensitivity of CCoV to disinfectants currently used for prophylaxis in kennel and dog breeding locations. The effects of three agents: alkyl‐dimethyl‐benzyl‐ammonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride and didecyl‐dimethyl‐ammonium chloride, on the infectivity titre of CCoV in A72 cell lines, were studied at different concentrations. Although they may regard a small number of agents, the findings showed that the sensitivity of CCoV to disinfectants varies and the differences are dose correlated. In general, virus inactivation implies a permanent loss of infectivity which can be evaluated in suspensions and hand disinfection tests.","veterinary"
"Stable E1 transformed cells, like PER.C6, are able to grow at scale and to high cell densities. E1‐deleted adenoviruses replicate to high titer in PER.C6 cells whereas subsequent deletion of E2A from the vector results in absence of replication in PER.C6 cells and drastically lowers the expression of adenovirus proteins in such cells. We therefore considered the use of an ΔE1/ΔE2 type 5 vector (Ad5) to deliver genes to PER.C6 cells growing in suspension with the aim to achieve high protein yield. To evaluate the utility of this system we constructed ΔE1/ΔE2 vector carrying different classes of protein, that is, the gene coding for spike protein derived from the Coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV), a gene coding for the SARS‐CoV receptor or the genes coding for an antibody shown to bind and neutralize SARS‐CoV (SARS‐AB). The ΔE1/ΔE2A‐vector backbones were rescued on a PER.C6 cell line engineered to constitutively over express the Ad5 E2A protein. Exposure of PER.C6 cells to low amounts (30 vp/cell) of ΔE1/ΔE2 vectors resulted in highly efficient (>80%) transduction of PER.C6 cells growing in suspension. The efficient cell transduction resulted in high protein yield (up to 60 picogram/cell/day) in a 4 day batch production protocol. FACS and ELISA assays demonstrated the biological activity of the transiently produced proteins. We therefore conclude that ΔE1/ΔE2 vectors in combination with the PER.C6 technology may provide a viable answer to the increasing demand for high quality, high yield recombinant protein. Biotechnol.

"Four clinical isolates of SARS coronavirus were serially passaged in two primate cell lines (FRhK4 and Vero E6). Viral genetic sequences encoding for structural proteins and open reading frames 6–8 were determined in the original clinical specimen, the initial virus isolate (passage 0) and at passages 5, 10, and 15. After 15 passages, a total of 15 different mutations were identified and 12 of them were non‐synonymous mutations. Seven of these mutations were recurrent mutation and all located at the spike, membrane, and Orf 8a protein encoding sequences. Mutations in the membrane protein and a deletion in ORF 6–8 were already observed in passage 0, suggesting these amino acid substitutions are important in the adaptation of the virus isolate in primate cell culture. A mutation in the spike gene (residue 24079) appeared to be unique to adaptation in FRhK4 cells. It is important to be aware of cell culture associated mutations when interpreting data on molecular evolution of SARS coronavirus. J. Med.

"The species Rhus chinensis Mill. (Anacardiaceae) is an important representative of the genus Rhus, which contains over 250 individual species found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide. Rhus chinensis has long been used by folk medicine practitioners in Asia. Leaves, roots, stem, bark, fruit and particularly the galls on Rhus chinensis leaves, Galla chinensis, are recognized to have preventative and therapeutic effects on different ailments (such as diarrhea, dysentery, rectal and intestinal cancer, diabetes mellitus, sepsis, oral diseases and inflammation). However, it is critical to separate evidence from anecdote. Fortunately, recent scientific research has revealed that Rhus chinensis compounds possess strong antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiarrheal and antioxidant activities. Moreover, compounds isolated from the stem of Rhus chinensis significantly suppressed HIV‐1 activity in vitro. Compounds from this plant were also found to inhibit enamel demineralization in vitro and enhance remineralization of dental enamel with fluoride. This review highlights claims from traditional and tribal medicinal lore and makes a contemporary summary of phytochemical, biological and pharmacological findings on this plant material. It aims to show that the pharmaceutical potential of this plant deserves closer attention. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","pharmacology"
"The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) platform has become an established manufacturing platform for the production of viral vaccines and gene therapy vectors. Nine BEVS‐derived products have been approved – four for human use (Cervarix®, Provenge®, Glybera® and Flublok®) and five for veterinary use (Porcilis® Pesti, BAYOVAC CSF E2®, Circumvent® PCV, Ingelvac CircoFLEX® and Porcilis® PCV). The BEVS platform offers many advantages, including manufacturing speed, flexible product design, inherent safety and scalability. This combination of features and product approvals has previously attracted interest from academic researchers, and more recently from industry leaders, to utilize BEVS to develop next generation vaccines, vectors for gene therapy, and other biopharmaceutical complex proteins. In this review, we explore the BEVS platform, detailing how it works, platform features and limitations and important considerations for manufacturing and regulatory approval. To underscore the growth in opportunities for BEVS‐derived products, we discuss the latest product developments in the gene therapy and influenza vaccine fields that follow in the wake of the recent product approvals of Glybera® and Flublok®, respectively. We anticipate that the utility of the platform will expand even further as new BEVS‐derived products attain licensure. Finally, we touch on some of the areas where new BEVS‐derived products are likely to emerge.","biotechnology"
"Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions in global health. The worldwide vaccination programs significantly reduced the number of deaths caused by infectious agents. A successful example was the eradication of smallpox in 1979 after two centuries of vaccination campaigns. Since the first variolation administrations until today, the knowledge on immunology has increased substantially. This knowledge combined with the introduction of cell culture and DNA recombinant technologies revolutionized vaccine design. This review will focus on vaccines against human viral pathogens, recent developments on vaccine design and cell substrates used for their manufacture. While the production of attenuated and inactivated vaccines requires the use of the respective permissible cell substrates, the production of recombinant antigens, virus‐like particles, vectored vaccines and chimeric vaccines requires the use – and often the development – of specific cell lines. Indeed, the development of novel modern viral vaccine designs combined with, the stringent safety requirements for manufacture, and the better understanding on animal cell metabolism and physiology are increasing the awareness on the importance of cell line development and engineering areas. A new era of modern vaccinology is arriving, offering an extensive toolbox to materialize novel and creative ideas in vaccine design and its manufacture.","biotechnology"
"Cytoplasmic dilysine motifs on transmembrane proteins are captured by coatomer α‐COP and β′‐COP subunits and packaged into COPI‐coated vesicles for Golgi‐to‐ER retrieval. Numerous ER/Golgi proteins contain K(x)Kxx motifs, but the rules for their recognition are unclear. We present crystal structures of α‐COP and β′‐COP bound to a series of naturally occurring retrieval motifs—encompassing KKxx, KxKxx and non‐canonical RKxx and viral KxHxx sequences. Binding experiments show that α‐COP and β′‐COP have generally the same specificity for KKxx and KxKxx, but only β′‐COP recognizes the RKxx signal. Dilysine motif recognition involves lysine side‐chain interactions with two acidic patches. Surprisingly, however, KKxx and KxKxx motifs bind differently, with their lysine residues transposed at the binding patches. We derive rules for retrieval motif recognition from key structural features: the reversed binding modes, the recognition of the C‐terminal carboxylate group which enforces lysine positional context, and the tolerance of the acidic patches for non‐lysine residues.","cell"
"Numerous reports have been published over the last decade assessing the potential of plants as useful hosts for the heterologous expression of clinically useful proteins. Significant progress has been made, in particular, in optimizing transgene transcription and translation in plants, and in elucidating the complex post‐translational modifications of proteins typical of the plant cell machinery. In this article, we address the important issue of recombinant protein degradation in plant expression platforms, which directly impacts on the final yield, homogeneity and overall quality of the resulting protein product. Unlike several more stable and structurally less complex pharmaceuticals, recombinant proteins present a natural tendency to structural heterogeneity, resulting in part from the inherent instability of polypeptide chains expressed in heterologous environments. Proteolytic processing, notably, may dramatically alter the structural integrity and overall accumulation of recombinant proteins in plant expression systems, both in planta during expression and ex planta after extraction. In this article, we describe the current strategies proposed to minimize protein hydrolysis in plant protein factories, including organ‐specific transgene expression, organelle‐specific protein targeting, the grafting of stabilizing protein domains to labile proteins, protein secretion in natural fluids and the co‐expression of companion protease inhibitors.","plant"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus, called the SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). Over 95% of well characterized cohorts of SARS have evidence of recent SARS‐CoV infection. The genome of SARS‐CoV has been sequenced and it is not related to any of the previously known human or animal coronaviruses. It is probable that SARS‐CoV was an animal virus that adapted to human‐human transmission in the recent past. The virus can be found in nasopharyngeal aspirate, urine and stools of SARS patients. Second generation reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays are able to detect SARS‐CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirates of approximately 80% of patients with SARS within the first 3 days of illness. Seroconversion for SARS‐CoV using immunofluorescence on infected cells is an excellent method of confirming the diagnosis, but antibody responses only appear around day 10 of the illness. Within the first 10 days the histological picture is that of acute phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with a mixture of inflammatory infiltrate, oedema and hyaline membrane formation. Desquamation of pneumocytes is prominent and consistent. After 10 days of illness the picture changes to one of organizing DAD with increased fibrosis, squamous metaplasia and multinucleated giant cells. The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of SARS is still unclear.","respiratory"
"Acute lung ischemia–reperfusion injury (ALIRI) is a serious disease that seriously affects human's life. In this study, we aimed to explore a more effective treatment method by combining human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) and angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for ALIRI. Fifty rats were firstly divided into five groups, namely sham surgery group (sham) and four model groups (model, ACE2, HUMSCs and HUMSCs + ACE2) that were reperfused with 0.1 ml physiological saline (PS), 0.1 ml PS containing 1 × 106 lentiviral‐ACE2/HUMSCs/ACE2 + UMSCs, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription‐PCR (qRT‐PCR) and western blot assays were then conducted to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines [intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM‐1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM‐1), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF‐α), nuclear factor κB (NF‐κB), platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF) and angiotensin II (Ang II)], antioxidant proteins [NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO‐1)], DNA damage and apoptotic indicators [BCL2‐associated X (Bax), cleaved caspase‐3 (C‐Csp 3), cleaved‐poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase (C‐PARP), Y‐H2AX], anti‐apoptotic indicator (Bcl‐2) and smooth muscle cell proliferation indicator [connexin 43 (Cx43)]. According to the qRT‐PCR and western results, the mRNA and protein expression levels of ICAM‐1, VCAM‐1, TNF‐α, NF‐κB, PDGF, Bax, C‐Csp 3, C‐PARP and Y‐H2AX were significantly higher in model group than those in sham group and they were significantly reduced by HUMSCs or ACE2 treatment (P < 0.05). On the contrary, Bcl‐2 showed an opposite expression trend with the previous proteins. The mRNA and protein levels of NQO1 and HO‐1 were sequentially increased in sham, model, ACE2, HUMSCs and HUMSCs + ACE2 groups. Besides, HUMSCs combined with ACE2 exhibited a better inhibition effect on ALIRI than HUMSCs or ACE2 alone (P < 0.05). In summary, HUMSCs combined with ACE2 was demonstrated to have the best therapeutic effect on ALIRI through anti‐inflammation, oxidative stress and anti‐apoptotic processes.

"Aim:  This study has two objectives: to study the clinical symptoms associated with the detection of the four human coronaviruses (HCoVs), 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 types, in the respiratory specimens sampled from hospitalised children in France between September 2004 and May 2005; and to develop a multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) assay allowing for the simultaneous detection of the four HCoVs. Methods:  1002 respiratory specimens were tested for HCoVs. The clinical and epidemiological data were compared on the basis of the type HCoV infection. Results:  A hundred coronaviruses, 33 NL63, 2229E, 27 OC43 and 38 HKU1, were detected in 97 (9.8%) of 1002 samples negative in routine tests. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the study children were compared in three groups, 24 OC43‐, 27 NL63‐ and 34 HKU1‐infected children. HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (50.5% vs. 29.4%). The significant difference in clinical presentation between the three coronavirus groups was the very low association between lower respiratory tract illness and HKU1 detection. Conclusions:  HCoV detection in hospitalised children without any other respiratory virus detection was associated with upper and a significant rate of lower respiratory tract illness. The four types of HCoVs were detected, and new types NL63 and HKU1 represented a substantial portion of detection. The multiplex RT‐PCR enabled a sensitive one‐time detection and the characterisation of all of the known HCoV types with the exception severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus.","pediatrics"
"Polymorphisms of human Fc γ‐receptor IIA (FcγRIIA) and mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) genes have been associated with susceptibility to or severity of some infectious diseases. In order to investigate whether these genetic factors might influence susceptibility to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐Cov) as well as the course and severity of the infection, we evaluated polymorphisms of FcγRIIA and MBL genes in DNA samples from a group of approximately 180 people from Hong Kong who were infected with SARS‐Cov. These included 132 patients who had moderate course of SARS infection (home subgroup), 26 patients with a severe course requiring treatment in an intensive care ward (ICU subgroup) and a subgroup of 22 patients who died from SARS (deceased subgroup). A total of 200 normal blood donors from the same region were used as controls. A significant association was found between the FcγRIIA‐R/R131 genotype and a severe course of SARS, with higher frequency of homozygosity for FcγRIIA‐R/R131 in the ICU subgroup of SARS patients when compared with controls (P = 0.03; odds ratio: 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1–9.1). In comparison with controls, a significant difference in linear trend distribution of FcγRIIA genotypes was seen among the severe SARS patients (ICU and deceased subgroups) without co‐morbidity, and the incidence of FcγRIIA‐H/H131 was lower in these patients as well. There were no significant differences in MBL genotypes and allele frequencies among SARS patients and controls. The study reveals that in addition to age and co‐morbidity, FcγRIIA polymorphism of individuals may also influence outcome after infection with the SARS‐Cov.","pathology"
"This issue of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics focuses on emerging infections. The outbreaks of the vaccine‐preventable diseases (e.g., measles) and the emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola) show us how small the world has become. These outbreaks also show the pressing need for effective public education and development of novel therapies. This issue covers various aspects of relevant therapeutic topics ranging from preclinical models, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, and clinical trial results, to education efforts in this area. Pharmacokinetic/dynamic modeling had an appreciable role in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, recent emerging infections. However, these gains could be lessened by poor adherence to therapies, which has contributed to the development of multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis. We must not forget lessons from previous infections, or they may reemerge.","pharmacology"
"Introduction: Since February 2013, a novel reassortant H7N9 virus associated with human deaths, but no apparent outbreaks in poultry and wild birds has emerged in eastern China. Objectives: The potential reemergence of H7N9 during next year's influenza season demand a further understanding of this important disease. Methods: Between March 1 and April 30, 2013, we obtained and analyzed clinical, epidemiologic and radiologic features, and virologic data from three laboratory‐confirmed patients of A H7N9 infection admitted in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. Results: All patients were middle to old aged (mean age 62 years) and overweight (mean body mass index 31) patients. Two patients were exposed to poultry directly or indirectly in food market. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Time between onset of symptoms and onset of respiratory failure (days) were 7–11 days. Two patients presented secondary invasive bacterial infections. All patients died on day 7 to day 86 after the onset of symptoms. Conclusions: Cross species poultry‐to‐person transmission of this new reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus can result in severe and fatal respiratory disease like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans. Reduplicate chest imaging examination is suggested for risky patients with fever and dyspnea. Secondary invasive bacterial infections and pneumothorax can cause severe and fatal consequence. Old age, obesity and presence of comorbidity may be associated with increased mortality. Pulmonary fibrosis can be seen at late stage of the disease.","respiratory"
"Acute lung ischemia‐reperfusion injury (ALIRI) is featured as non‐specific alveolar damage, lung edema and hypoxemia, often occurring within 72 h after surgery. It is the leading cause for primary graft failure and mortality after lung surgery and transplantation. Here we aimed to find a more effective therapeutic approach to treat ALIRI. We evaluated the combinational effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) and angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the rat ALIRI model. HUMSCs were isolated for lentiviral‐ACE2 transfection. Fifty rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham surgery, physiological saline (PS), ACE2, HUMSCs and HUMSCs‐ACE2 group. Several physiological, biochemical and histological indicators were examined and compared among the five groups, such as blood oxygen saturation (Sat O2%) and right ventricular systolic blood pressure (RVSBP), pulmonary morphology observations, several kinds of cell markers and the abundance of glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). Compared with HUMSCs and ACE2 groups, HUMSCs‐ACE2 group showed lighter lung injuries, higher CD31 and vWF expression (endothelial cell surface markers), lower γ‐H2AX (DNA damage marker) and CD68 (inflammatory cell marker) and higher anti‐oxidants expression (GR, GPX and NQO1). The results indicated that HUMSCs harbouring ACE2 were more effective than either HUMSCs or ACE2 alone in alleviating the ALIRI damages. The synergistic effects of HUMSCs and ACE2 provide informative clues for mechanism study and therapeutic method development of ALIRI. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cell"
"Increasing antiviral drug resistance is a major concern for treating influenza, especially in a pandemic setting when the availability of a protective vaccine is uncertain. Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses; there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus‐specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad‐spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high‐throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.

"The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) led to a rapid response not only to contain the outbreak but also to identify possible therapeutic interventions, including the generation of human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs). hmAbs may be used therapeutically without the drawbacks of chimeric or animal Abs. Several different methods have been used to generate SARS‐CoV specific neutralizing hmAbs including the immunization of transgenic mice, cloning of small chain variable regions from naïve and convalescent patients, and the immortalization of convalescent B cells. Irrespective of the techniques used, the majority of hmAbs specifically reacted with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein and likely prevented receptor binding. However, several hmAbs that can bind to epitopes either within the RBD, located N terminal of the RBD or in the S2 domain, and neutralize the virus with or without inhibiting receptor binding have been identified. Therapeutic utility of hmAbs has been further elucidated through the identification of potential combinations of hmAbs that could neutralize viral variants including escape mutants selected using hmAbs. These results suggest that a cocktail of hmAbs that can bind to unique epitopes and have different mechanisms of action might be of clinical utility against SARS‐CoV infection, and indicate that a similar approach may be applied to treat other viral infections.

"Abstract  Infection risk assessment is very useful in understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and in predicting the risk of these diseases to the public. Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells–Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose‐response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells–Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose‐response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed. Practical Implications: This review article summarizes the strengths and limitations of the Wells–Riley and the dose‐response models for risk assessment of respiratory diseases. Even with many efforts by various investigators to develop and modify the risk assessment models, some limitations still persist. This review serves as a reference for further development of infection risk assessment models of respiratory diseases. The Wells–Riley model and dose‐response model offer specific advantages. Risk assessors can select the approach that is suitable to their particular conditions to perform risk assessment.","public"

"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) enters the host cells via endocytic pathway to achieve viral replication in the cytoplasm. Here, we performed LC‐MS/MS coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification labeling of differentially abundant proteins of IBDV‐infected cells using a subcellular fractionation strategy. We show that the viral infection regulates the abundance and/or subcellular localization of 3211 proteins during early infection. In total, 23 cellular proteins in the cytoplasmic proteome and 34 in the nuclear proteome were significantly altered after virus infection. These differentially abundant proteins are involved in such biological processes as immune response, signal transduction, RNA processing, macromolecular biosynthesis, energy metabolism, virus binding, and cellular apoptosis. Moreover, transcriptional profiles of the 25 genes corresponding to the identified proteins were analyzed by quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis clustered the differentially abundant proteins primarily into the mTOR pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and interferon‐β signaling cascades. Confocal microscopy showed colocalization of the viral protein VP3 with host proteins heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1, nuclear factor 45, apoptosis inhibitor 5, nuclear protein localization protein 4 and DEAD‐box RNA helicase 42 during the virus infection. Together, these identified subcellular constituents provide important information for understanding host–IBDV interactions and underlying mechanisms of IBDV infection and pathogenesis.","chemistry"
"Respiratory viruses can cause a wide spectrum of pulmonary diseases, ranging from mild, upper respiratory tract infections to severe and life‐threatening lower respiratory tract infections, including the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Viral clearance and subsequent recovery from infection require activation of an effective host immune response; however, many immune effector cells may also cause injury to host tissues. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract, with 10% and 35% overall mortality rates, respectively; however, >50% mortality rates are seen in the aged and immunosuppressed populations. While these viruses are susceptible to interferon treatment in vitro, they both encode numerous genes that allow for successful evasion of the host immune system until after high virus titres have been achieved. In this review, we discuss the importance of the innate immune response and the development of lung pathology following human coronavirus infection. © 2014 The Authors.

"Ebola viruses and Marburg viruses include some of the most virulent and fatal pathogens known to humans. These viruses cause severe haemorrhagic fevers, with case fatality rates in the range 25–90%. The diagnosis of filovirus using formalin‐fixed tissues from fatal cases poses a significant challenge. The most characteristic histopathological findings are seen in the liver; however, the findings overlap with many other viral and non‐viral haemorrhagic diseases. The need to distinguish filovirus infections from other haemorrhagic fevers, particularly in areas with multiple endemic viral haemorrhagic agents, is of paramount importance. In this review we discuss the current state of knowledge of filovirus infections and their pathogenesis, including histopathological findings, epidemiology, modes of transmission and filovirus entry and spread within host organisms. The pathogenesis of filovirus infections is complex and involves activation of the mononuclear phagocytic system, with release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, endothelial dysfunction, alterations of the innate and adaptive immune systems, direct organ and endothelial damage from unrestricted viral replication late in infection, and coagulopathy. Although our understanding of the pathogenesis of filovirus infections has rapidly increased in the past few years, many questions remain unanswered.

"Human coronaviruses (CoVs) mostly cause a common cold that is mild and self‐limiting. Zoonotic transmission of CoVs such as the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)‐CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐CoV, on the other hand, may be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection. This article reviews the clinical and pathological data available on MERS and compares it to SARS. Most importantly, chest radiographs and imaging results of patients with MERS show features that resemble the findings of organizing pneumonia, different from the lesions in SARS patients, which show fibrocellular intra‐alveolar organization with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia‐like pattern. These findings are in line with differences in the induction of cytopathological changes, induction of host gene responses and sensitivity to the antiviral effect of interferons in vitro when comparing both MERS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV. The challenge will be to translate these findings into an integrated picture of MERS pathogenesis in humans and to develop intervention strategies that will eventually allow the effective control of this newly emerging infectious disease.

"Development of complementary and/or alternative drugs for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is still much needed from clinical and economic points of view. Antiviral substances obtained from medicinal plants are potentially good targets to study. Glycyrrhiza uralensis and G. glabra have been commonly used in both traditional and modern medicine. In this study, extracts of G. uralensis roots and their components were examined for anti‐HCV activity using an HCV cell culture system. It was found that a methanol extract of G. uralensis roots and its chloroform fraction possess anti‐HCV activity with 50%‐inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 20.0 and 8.0 μg/mL, respectively. Through bioactivity‐guided purification and structural analysis, glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol and liquiritigenin were isolated and identified as anti‐HCV compounds, their IC50 being 8.8, 7.2, 4.6 and 16.4 μg/mL, respectively. However, glycyrrhizin, the major constituent of G. uralensis, and its monoammonium salt, showed only marginal anti‐HCV activity. It was also found that licochalcone A and glabridin, known to be exclusive constituents of G. inflata and G. glabra, respectively, did have anti‐HCV activity, their IC50 being 2.5 and 6.2 μg/mL, respectively. Another chalcone, isoliquiritigenin, also showed anti‐HCV activity, with an IC50 of 3.7 μg/mL. Time‐of‐addition analysis revealed that all Glycyrrhiza‐derived anti‐HCV compounds tested in this study act at the post‐entry step. In conclusion, the present results suggest that glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol and liquiritigenin isolated from G. uralensis, as well as isoliquiritigenin, licochalcone A and glabridin, would be good candidates for seed compounds to develop antivirals against HCV.","microbiology"
"Objectives:  This study aimed to isolate and characterize stem/progenitor cells, starting from normal airway epithelia, obtained from human adults. Materials and methods:  Cultures of multicellular spheroids were obtained from human lung tissue specimens after mechanical and enzymatic digestion. Tissue‐specific markers were detected on their cells by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques. Ultrastructural morphology of the spheroids (termed as bronchospheres) was evaluated by electron microscopy, gene expression analysis was performed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and gene down‐regulation was analysed by an RNA interference technique. Results:  Bronchospheres were found to be composed of cells with high expression of stem cell regulatory genes, which was not or was only weakly detectable in original tissues. Morphological analysis showed that bronchospheres were composed of mixed phenotype cells with type II alveolar and Clara cell features, highlighting their airway resident cell origin. In addition to displaying specific pulmonary and epithelial commitment, bronchospheres showed mesenchymal features. Silencing of the Slug gene, known to play a pivotal role in epithelial–mesenchymal transition processes and which was highly expressed in bronchospheres but not in original tissue, led bronchospheres to gain a differentiated bronchial/alveolar phenotype and to lose the stemness gene expression pattern. Conclusions:  Ours is the first study to describe ex vivo expansion of stem/progenitor cells resident in human lung epithelia, and our results suggest that the epithelial–mesenchymal transition process, still active in a subset of airway cells, may regulate transit of stem/progenitor cells towards epithelial differentiation.","cell"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) infects many organs, such as lung, liver, and immune organs and causes life‐threatening atypical pneumonia, SARS causes high morbidity and mortality rates. The molecular mechanism of SARS pathogenesis remains elusive. Inflammatory stimuli can activate IκB kinase (IKK) signalsome and subsequently the nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB), which influences gene expression of cyclooxygenase‐2 (Cox‐2) along with other transcription factors. In this work, we found that the membrane (M) protein of SARS‐CoV physically interacted with IKKβ using a co‐immunoprecipitation assay (IPA). Expression of M suppressed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α) induced NF‐κB activation using a luciferase reporter assay. Further investigation showed M protein suppressed Cox‐2 expression using a luciferase reporter gene assay, RT‐PCR and Western blot analysis. The carboxyl terminal of M protein was sufficient for the M protein function. Together, these results indicate that SARS‐CoV M suppresses NF‐κB activity probably through a direct interaction with IKKβ, resulting in lower Cox‐2 expression. Suppression of NF‐κB activity and Cox‐2 expression may contribute to SARS pathogenesis. J. Med. Virol. 79:1431–1439, 2007. © Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","virology"
"In developing countries, viruses causing respiratory disease are a major concern of public health. During January 2010–December 2011, 2,737 patients with acute respiratory infection from the outpatient departments as well as patients admitted to hospitals were screened for different respiratory viruses. Nasal and or throat swabs were collected and transported to the laboratory where initial screening of influenza A and influenza B viruses was performed. The samples were tested further for influenza C virus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, human rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus by conventional RT‐ PCR. The study revealed that the majority of the patients were under 5 years of age; both due to their higher susceptibility to respiratory infections and presentation to hospitals. Out of 2,737 patients enrolled in this study, 59% were found positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Influenza B infection was detected in 12% of patients followed by influenza A (11.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (7.1%), parainfluenza virus‐2 (6%), metapneumovirus (3%), parainfluenza virus‐3 (1%), parainfluenza virus‐4 (0.6%), parainfluenza virus‐1 (0.3%), influenza C (0.2%) and human rhinovirus (0.2%).

Lycorine, which is a natural plant alkaloid, has been shown to possess antiviral activities against flaviviruses. In this study, a series of novel lycorine derivatives were synthesized and assayed for their inhibition of dengue virus (DENV) in cell cultures. Among the lycorine analogues, 1‐acetyllycorine exhibited the most potent anti‐DENV activity (EC50=0.4 μM) with a reduced cytotoxicity (CC50>300 μM), which resulted in a selectivity index (CC50/EC50) of more than 750. The ketones 1‐acetyl‐2‐oxolycorine (EC50=1.8 μM) and 2‐oxolycorine (EC50=0.5 μM) also exhibited excellent antiviral activities with low cytotoxicity. Structure–activity relationships for the lycorine derivatives against DENV are discussed. A three‐dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship model was established by using a comparative molecular‐field analysis protocol in order to rationalize the experimental results. Further modifications of the hydroxy group at the C1 position with retention of a ketone at the C2 position could potentially lead to inhibitors with improved overall properties.","pharmacology"
"A real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay was initially developed in China to detect mumps genome. The primers and TaqMan‐MGB probe were selected from regions of the hemagglutinin gene of mumps virus. The primers and probe for the real‐time PCR were evaluated by both laboratories in China and in the UK using three different pieces of equipment, LightCycler (Roche), MJ DNA Engine Option® 2 (BIO‐RAD) and TaqMan (ABI Prism) on different samples. The reaction was performed with either a one‐step (China) or two‐step (UK) process. The sensitivity (10 copies) was estimated using a serial dilution of constructed mumps‐plasmid DNA and a linear standard curve was obtained between 10 and 107 DNA copies/reaction, which can be used to quantify viral loads. The detection limit on cell culture‐grown virus was approximately 2 pfu/ml with a two‐step assay on TaqMan, which was equivalent to the sensitivity of the nested PCR routinely used in the UK. The specificity was proved by testing a range of respiratory viruses and several genotypes of mumps strains. The concentration of primers and probe is 22 pmol and 6.25 or 7 pmol respectively for a 25 µl reaction. The assay took 3 hr from viral RNA extraction to complete the detection using any of the three pieces of equipment. Three hundred forty‐one (35 in China and 306 in the UK) clinical specimens were tested, the results showing that this real‐time PCR assay is suitable for rapid and accurate detection of mumps virus RNA in various types of clinical specimens.

"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most serious and prevalent health problems worldwide. Current anti‐HBV medications have a number of drawbacks, such as adverse effects and drug resistance; thus, novel potential anti‐HBV reagents are needed. Selenium (Se) has been shown to be involved in both human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections, but its role in HBV infection remains unclear. To address this, sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) was applied to three HBV cell models: HepG2.2.15 cells, and HuH‐7 cells transfected with either 1.1 or 1.3× HBV plasmids. Cytotoxicity of Na2SeO3 was examined by Cell Counting Kit‐8. Levels of viral antigen expression, transcripts, and encapsidated viral DNA were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, northern blot, and Southern blot, respectively. There was no obvious cytotoxicity in either HepG2.2.15 or HuH‐7 cells with <2.5 µM Na2SeO3. Below this concentration, Na2SeO3 suppressed HBsAg and HBeAg production, HBV transcript level, and amount of genomic DNA in all three tested models, and suppression level was enhanced in line with increases in Na2SeO3 concentration or treatment time. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of Na2SeO3 on HBV replication can be further enhanced by combined treatment with lamivudine, entecavir, or adefovir. Thus, the present study clearly proves that Na2SeO3 suppresses HBV protein expression, transcription, and genome replication in hepatoma cell models in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner. J. Med.

"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a double‐stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family. The VP1 protein of BTV is the viral RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is responsible for the replication of the viral genome. Currently there is no structural information available for VP1. By manual alignment of BTV, Reovirus and other viral RdRps we have generated a model for the structure of VP1, the RdRp of BTV. The structure can be divided into three domains: an N‐terminal domain, a C‐terminal domain, and a central polymerase domain. Mutation of the putative catalytic site in the central polymerase domain by site‐directed mutagenesis abrogated in vitro replicase activity. Each of the domains was expressed individually and subsequently partially purified to obtain direct evidence for the location of polymerase activity and the nucleoside triphosphate binding site. The nucleoside triphosphate binding site was located by showing that CTP only bound to the full‐length protein or to the polymerase domain and not to either of the other two domains. None of the domains had catalytic activity when tested individually or in tandem but when all three domains were mixed together the RdRp activity was reconstituted. This is the first report of the reconstitution of a functional viral RdRp in vitro from individual domains. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 86: 83–94, 2007.

"Children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection shed virus for variable periods. The aim of this study was to quantify the viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with RSV throughout their hospitalization. This study included 37 children who were admitted with a diagnosis of RSV infection based on a positive rapid diagnostic test. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients every day, from admission to discharge. Viral detection and quantification were performed using quantitative real‐time PCR. Of the 37 patients, RSV‐A was detected in 29 and RSV‐B in 6. Two patients were PCR‐negative for any type of RSV. RSV‐A was detected in 12 of 16 patients (75%) 6 days after admission. These patients shed detectable virus from days 1 to 12, and for a significantly longer period (mean 5.7 days) than RSV‐B (mean 3.8 days) patients. Half of the RSV‐A patients were also positive on day 14 following onset. RSV‐A was detected in patients <12 months of age for significantly longer periods after onset than in patients ≥12 months of age. RSV‐A viral load was negatively correlated with days from admission and days from onset. Because RSV shedding was frequently prolonged, the hospitalized children may have contracted RSV as a nosocomial infection. To prevent nosocomial RSV infections in hospital wards, healthcare workers must take appropriate infection control measures and provide adequate guidance on hand washing to the family of the patient.

"Within the last decade new technologies have been developed and implemented which employ light, often in the presence of a photosensitizer, to inactivate pathogens that reside in human blood products for the purpose of transfusion. These pathogen reduction technologies attempt to find the proper balance between pathogen kill and cell quality. Each system utilizes various chemistries that not only impact which pathogens they can inactivate and how, but also how the treatments affect the plasma and cellular proteins and to what degree. This paper aims to present the various chemical mechanisms for pathogen reduction in transfusion medicine that are currently practiced or in development.","biophysics"
"A structure‐based in silico virtual drug discovery procedure was assessed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus main protease serving as a case study. First, potential compounds were extracted from protein–ligand complexes selected from Protein Data Bank database based on structural similarity to the target protein. Later, the set of compounds was ranked by docking scores using a Electronic High‐Throughput Screening flexible docking procedure to select the most promising molecules. The set of best performing compounds was then used for similarity search over the 1 million entries in the Ligand.Info Meta‐Database. Selected molecules having close structural relationship to a 2‐methyl‐2,4‐pentanediol may provide candidate lead compounds toward the development of novel allosteric severe acute respiratory syndrome protease inhibitors.","chemistry"
"Abstract  Staphylococcus aureus was used as an indicator to study the origin and spread of microbial aerosol in and around chicken houses. Air samples indoor, upwind (10 and 50 m), and downwind (10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m) of four chicken houses were collected using Andersen‐6 stages sampler. The concentrations of S. aureus were determined for every sample site. Isolation of S. aureus from chicken feces was performed according to the standard method. The genetic relationship among the isolates was determined by profiles of PCR‐amplified repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP‐PCR) elements. The results showed that the concentrations of S. aureus indoor of four chicken houses were higher than those upwind and downwind sites (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but there were no significant concentration differences among downwind sites (P > 0.05). The fingerprints and the phylogenetic tree indicated that a part of the S. aureus (55.6%, 10/18) isolates from indoor air had the same REP‐PCR fingerprints as feces isolates. Consequently, most isolates (57.1%, 20/35) from downwind 10, 50, 100, 200, even 400 m had the same REP‐PCR fingerprints as those from indoor or feces. These data indicated that some isolates from downwind and indoor originated from the chicken feces. However, those isolates from upwind had low similarity (similarity index 0.6–0.87) to those from indoor or feces. Therefore, the isolates upwind were not from the chicken feces or indoor. These results suggest that microbes in chicken feces can be aerosolized and spread indoor and outdoor, especially to downwind of the chicken houses. It should have an important epidemiological and public health significance. Practical Implications: Thus, the use of S. aureus as an indicator to study the origin and spread of airborne pathogens from chicken houses is potentially useful for enhancing public health and understanding the airborne epidemiology of this pathogen. Meanwhile it can provide evidence for studying the spreading model of airborne pathogens.","public"
"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes an acute, highly contagious, and devastating viral enteric disease with a high mortality rate in suckling pigs. A large‐scale outbreak of PED occurred in China in 2010, with PEDV emerging in the United States in 2013 and spreading rapidly, posing significant economic and public health concerns. In this study, LC–MS/MS coupled to iTRAQ labeling was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed cellular proteins in PEDV‐infected Vero cells. We identified 49 differentially expressed cellular proteins, of which 8 were upregulated and 41 downregulated. These differentially expressed proteins were involved in apoptosis, signal transduction, and stress responses. Based on these differentially expressed proteins, we propose that PEDV might utilize apoptosis and extracellular signal regulated kinases pathways for maximum viral replication. Our study is the first attempt to analyze the protein profile of PEDV‐infected cells by quantitative proteomics, and we believe our findings provide valuable information with respect to better understanding the host response to PEDV infection.","biochemistry"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious health threat and its early diagnosis is important for infection control and potential treatment of the disease. Diagnostic tools require rapid and accurate methods, of which a capture ELISA method may be useful. Toward this goal, we have prepared and characterized soluble full‐length nucleocapsid proteins (N protein) from SARS and 229E human coronaviruses. N proteins form oligomers, mostly as dimers at low concentration. These two N proteins degrade rapidly upon storage and the major degraded N protein is the C‐terminal fragment of amino acid (aa) 169–422. Taken together with other data, we suggest that N protein is a two‐domain protein, with the N‐terminal aa 50–150 as the RNA‐binding domain and the C‐terminal aa 169–422 as the dimerization domain. Polyclonal antibodies against the SARS N protein have been produced and the strong binding sites of the anti‐nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibodies produced were mapped to aa 1–20, aa 150–170 and aa 390–410. These sites are generally consistent with those mapped by sera obtained from SARS patients. The SARS anti‐NP antibody was able to clearly detect SARS virus grown in Vero E6 cells and did not cross‐react with the NP from the human coronavirus 229E. We have predicted several antigenic sites (15–20 amino acids) of S, M and N proteins and produced antibodies against those peptides, some of which could be recognized by sera obtained from SARS patients. Antibodies against the NP peptides could detect the cognate N protein clearly. Further refinement of these antibodies, particularly large‐scale production of monoclonal antibodies, could lead to the development of useful diagnostic kits for diseases associated with SARS and other human coronaviruses.","biochemistry"
"Electron microscopy and infrared and Raman spectroscopy have been used here to study the morphology, size distribution, secondary and tertiary structures of protein particles assembled from a truncated hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein covering the first 120 aa. Particles of pure protein, having similar morphology and size distribution of those of nucleocapsids found in sera from HCV‐infected patients, have been visualized for the first time. The secondary structure of these protein particles involve β‐sheet enrichment in relation to its protein monomer. Tertiary/quaternary structure has also been studied using the dynamics of H/D exchange. With this aim infrared spectra were measured as a function of H/D exchange time and subsequently analyzed by principal component analysis and two‐dimensional correlation spectroscopy. Temporal dynamics of exchange for these protein particles were as follows: arginine residues exchanged first, followed by turn and unordered structures, followed by β‐sheets which may act as linkers of protein monomers.

"The objective of this study was to investigate the use of chloroquine (CLQ) as an antiviral agent against dengue. Chloroquine, an amine acidotropic drug known to affect intracellular exocytic pathways by increasing endosomal pH, was used in the in vitro treatment of U937 cells infected with dengue virus type 2 (DENV‐2). Viral replication was assessed by quantification of virus produced through detection of copy numbers of DENV‐2 RNA, plaque assay and indirect immunofluorescence. qRT‐PCR and plaque assays were used to quantify the DENV‐2 load in infected U937 cells after CLQ treatment. It was found that a dose of 50 μg/mL of CLQ was not toxic to the cells and resulted in significantly less virus production in infected U937 cells than occurred in untreated cells. In the present work, CLQ was effective against DENV‐2 replication in U937 cells, and also caused a statistically significant reduction in expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The present study indicates that CLQ may be used to reduce viral yield in U937 cells.","microbiology"
"Aim:  Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a type I membrane protein that antagonizes the action of angiotensin II. Because of the need for invasive kidney biopsy, little is known about the role of renal ACE2 in human kidney diseases. The authors studied if urinary ACE2 could provide a novel clue to renal ACE2 in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods:  Subjects were 190 patients with CKD including 38 patients with diabetic nephropathy and 36 healthy subjects. Parameters were urinary ACE2 by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, blood pressure, casual plasma glucose, proteinuria, microalbuminuria, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Urine and serum samples were also subjected to western blotting of ACE2. Results:  Western blotting confirmed increased urinary ACE2 levels in patients with CKD. Urinary ACE2 was significantly higher in patients with CKD than healthy subjects (median 9.64 (interquartile range, 4.41–16.89) vs 1.50 (0.40–2.33) mg/g·creatinine, P < 0.001) and in patients with diabetic nephropathy than patients without diabetic nephropathy (median 13.16 (interquartile range 6.81–18.70) vs 8.90 (4.19–16.67) mg/g·creatinine, P < 0.05). No significant difference in urinary ACE2 was observed by the use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker. Conclusion:  Urinary ACE2 could be used as a non‐invasive marker to understand the role of renal ACE2 in CKD.","urology"
"Although the widespread occurrence of calf diarrhoea (CD) bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infections have been reported in most cattle producing countries, only the genetic differences in the BCoVs from American and Canadian isolates and/or strains have been identified and compared. Hence, it is unclear if the BCoVs circulating in the other countries have distinct genetic characteristics. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of CD BCoVs based on the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the spike (S) and haemagglutinin/esterase (HE) proteins in South Korea. RT‐PCR and nested PCR using the primer pairs specific to the nucleocapsid gene, BCoVs detected the BCoVs in 56 (15.6%) of 359 diarrhoeic faecal samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire S gene indicated that 10 Korean CD BCoV strains clustered with other Korean BCoV strains with different clinical forms but were different from the American and Canadian BCoV strains. Moreover, the phylogenetic data of the aa sequences of the HE gene revealed all the Korean CD strains to be distinct from the other Korean BCoV strains with different clinical forms. These results suggest that the Korean BCoVs cause endemic infections in diarrhoeic calves in Jeonnam province and have taken a different evolutionary pathway from the BCoVs in other countries. Moreover, the different BCoV strains are circulating in the different clinical forms in South Korea. These results also suggest that vaccines against the BCoVs can be developed with each Korean BCoV in different clinical forms.","veterinary"
"In order to determine highly immunogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) epitope peptides capable of inducing long‐lasting immunity, we first screened immunoglobulin‐G (IgG) antibodies reactive to 197 different overlapping 15‐mers from the SARS‐CoV proteins in the sera of three infected patients. Forty‐two peptides among them were reactive to the sera from all three patients. Consequently, we tested for the reactivity of these 42 peptides to patients' sera (n = 45) at 6‐month post‐infection. The significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies specific to three (S791, M207 and N161) of 42 peptides were detectable in the post‐infection sera from 23 (51%), 27 (60%) and 19 (42%) of 45 patients, respectively. These three peptides, recognized by their long‐lasting immunity, may provide a better understanding of the immunogenicity of SARS‐CoV.","pathology"
"The article summarises the results of more than 30 years of research on palmitoylation (S‐acylation) of viral proteins, the post‐translational attachment of fatty acids to cysteine residues of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Analysing viral proteins is not only important to characterise the cellular pathogens but also instrumental to decipher the palmitoylation machinery of cells. This comprehensive review describes methods to identify S‐acylated proteins and covers the fundamental biochemistry of palmitoylation: the location of palmitoylation sites in viral proteins, the fatty acid species found in S‐acylated proteins, the intracellular site of palmitoylation and the enzymology of the reaction. Finally, the functional consequences of palmitoylation are discussed regarding binding of proteins to membranes or membrane rafts, entry of enveloped viruses into target cells by spike‐mediated membrane fusion as well as assembly and release of virus particles from infected cells. The topics are described mainly for palmitoylated proteins of influenza virus, but proteins of other important pathogens, such as the causative agents of AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, and of model viruses are discussed.","cell"
"Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently discovered homologue of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) that is thought to counterbalance ACE. ACE2 cleaves angiotensin I and angiotensin II into the inactive angiotensin 1–9, and the vasodilator and anti‐proliferative angiotensin 1–7, respectively. ACE2 is known to be present in human kidney, but no data on renal disease are available to date. Renal biopsies from 58 patients with diverse primary and secondary renal diseases were studied (hypertensive nephropathy n = 5, IgA glomerulopathy n = 8, minimal change nephropathy n = 7, diabetic nephropathy n = 8, focal glomerulosclerosis n = 5, vasculitis n = 7, and membranous glomerulopathy n = 18) in addition to 17 renal transplants and 18 samples from normal renal tissue. Immunohistochemical staining for ACE2 was scored semi‐quantitatively. In control kidneys, ACE2 was present in tubular and glomerular epithelium and in vascular smooth muscle cells and the endothelium of interlobular arteries. In all primary and secondary renal diseases, and renal transplants, neo‐expression of ACE2 was found in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium. There were no differences between the various renal disorders, or between acute and chronic rejection and control transplants. ACE inhibitor treatment did not alter ACE2 expression. In primary and secondary renal disease, and in transplanted kidneys, neo‐expression of ACE2 occurs in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium. Further studies should elucidate the possible protective mechanisms involved in the de novo expression of ACE2 in renal disease. Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

"Mammalian cells are the expression system of choice for therapeutic proteins, especially those requiring complex post‐translational modifications. Traditionally, these cells are grown in medium supplemented with serum and other animal‐ or human‐derived components to support viability and productivity. Such proteins are also typically added as excipients and stabilizers in the final drug formulation. However, the transmission of hepatitis B in the 1970s and of hepatitis C and HIV in the 1980s through plasma‐derived factor VIII concentrates had catastrophic consequences for hemophilia patients. Thus, due to regulatory concerns about the inherent potential for transmission of infectious agents as well as the heterogeneity and lack of reliability of the serum supply, a trend has emerged to eliminate the use of plasma‐derived additives in the production and formulation of recombinant protein therapeutics. This practice began with products used in the treatment of hemophilia and is progressively expanding throughout the entire industry. The plasma‐free method of producing recombinant therapeutics is accomplished by the use of both cell culture media and final product formulations that do not contain animal‐ or human‐derived additives. A number of recombinant therapeutic proteins for the treatment of several different diseases have been produced by plasma‐free processes, with the objective of improving safety by eliminating blood‐borne pathogens or by reducing immunogenicity. This review describes the factors that drove the development of plasma‐free protein therapeutics and provides examples of advances in manufacturing that have made possible the removal of human and animal‐derived products from all steps of recombinant protein production.","biotechnology"
"Summary.  New pathogens and antimicrobial‐resistant forms of older pathogens continue to emerge, some with the potential for rapid, global spread and high morbidity and mortality. Pathogens can emerge either through introduction into a new population or when the interaction with the vector changes; emergence is also influenced by microbiological adaptation and change, global travel patterns, domestic and wild animal contact and other variants in human ecology and behaviour. Quick, decisive action to detect and control novel pathogens, and thereby contain outbreaks and prevent further transmission, is frequently hampered by incomplete or inadequate data about a new or re‐emerging pathogen. Three examples of pathogens that are current causes for human health concern are avian influenza, West Nile virus (WNV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Pathogens directly or indirectly transmitted by aerosolized droplets, such as avian influenza and SARS, pose considerable containment challenges. Rapid screening tests for other newly described pathogens such as WNV require time for development and may be <100% reliable. The importance of vigilance in the detection and control of newly recognized infectious threats cannot be overstressed. The presence of infectious agents in the blood supply could again have a significant impact on the safe use of both blood and blood‐derived products in the care of patients with haemophilia, as did the human immunodeficiency virus in the 1980s. Emerging pathogens will continue to be a reality requiring the collaborative efforts of public health and individual healthcare providers worldwide to contain outbreaks and prevent transmission.","hematology"
"The identification of poliovirus receptor‐like 4 (PVRL4) as the second natural receptor for measles virus (MV) has closed a major gap in our understanding of measles pathogenesis, and explains how this predominantly lymphotropic virus breaks through epithelial barriers to transmit to a susceptible host. Advances in the development of wild‐type, recombinant MVs which express fluorescent proteins making infected cells readily detectable in living tissues and animals, has also increased our understanding of this important and highly transmissible human disease. Thus, it is timely to review how these advances have provided new insights into MV infection of immune, epithelial and neural cells. This demands access to primate samples that help us understand the early and acute stages of the disease, which are challenging to dissect due to the mild/self‐limiting nature of the infection. It also requires well‐characterized and rather rare human tissue samples from patients who succumb to neurological sequelae to help study the consequences of the long‐term persistence of this RNA virus in vivo. Collectively, these studies have provided unique insights into how the use of two cellular receptors, CD150 and PVRL4, governs the in vivo tissue‐specific temporal patterns of virus spread and resulting pathological lesions. Analysis of tissue samples has also demonstrated the importance of differing mechanisms of virus cell‐to‐cell spread within lymphoid, epithelial and neural tissues in the dissemination of MV during acute and long‐term persistent infections. Given the incentive to eradicate MV globally, and the inevitable question as to whether or not vaccination should cease in light of the existence of closely related morbilliviruses, a thorough understanding of measles pathological lesions is essential.

"Viruses cause a wide range of human diseases, ranging from acute self‐resolving conditions to acute fatal diseases. Effects that arise long after the primary infection can also increase the propensity for chronic conditions or lead to the development of cancer. Recent advances in the fields of virology and pathology have been fundamental in improving our understanding of viral pathogenesis, in providing improved vaccination strategies and in developing newer, more effective treatments for patients worldwide. The reviews assembled here focus on the interface between virology and pathology and encompass aspects of both the clinical pathology of viral disease and the underlying disease mechanisms. Articles on emerging diseases caused by Ebola virus, Marburg virus, coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, Nipah virus and noroviruses are followed by reviews of enteroviruses, HIV infection, measles, mumps, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The issue concludes with a series of articles reviewing the relationship between viruses and cancer, including the role played by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and carcinoma; how human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the development of skin cancer; the involvement of hepatitis B virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma; and the mechanisms by which Kaposi's sarcoma‐associated herpesvirus (KSHV) leads to Kaposi's sarcoma. We hope that this collection of articles will be of interest to a wide range of scientists and clinicians at a time when there is a renaissance in the appreciation of the power of pathology as virologists dissect the processes of disease.

"Viruses are the major cause of pediatric acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and yet many suspected cases of infection remain uncharacterized. We employed 17 PCR assays and retrospectively screened 315 specimens selected by season from a predominantly pediatric hospital‐based population. Before the Brisbane respiratory virus research study commenced, one or more predominantly viral pathogens had been detected in 15.2% (n = 48) of all specimens. The Brisbane study made an additional 206 viral detections, resulting in the identification of a microbe in 67.0% of specimens. After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89.9%). Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n = 140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n = 25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n = 18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n = 15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n = 12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n = 11), and human herpesvirus‐6 (n = 11). HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37.8% (n = 31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Genotyping of the HRV VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A1 and A2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found to be type C. This study describes the high microbial burden imposed by HRVs, HMPV, HRSV, HCoVs, and the newly identified virus, HBoV on a predominantly paediatric hospital population with suspected acute respiratory tract infections and proposes a new formulation of viral targets for future diagnostic research studies.

"Background and Objectives  Various measures to inactivate/remove viruses have been implemented for manufacturing plasma‐derived products. Here, we examined the heat inactivation ability of an agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS coronavirus (CoV). Materials and Methods  The Frankfurt‐1 strain of SARS‐CoV was incorporated in manufacturing processes of several products by using samples collected immediately before liquid heat treatment at 60 °C. Results  SARS‐CoV was easily inactivated by this treatment for 60 min in all in‐process samples. However, the different composition of the tested samples affected the heat sensitivity of the virus strain: the infectivity of the virus in Antithrombin III preparation still remained after heating for 30 min at 60 °C. Conclusion  If by rare chance SARS‐CoV contaminates source plasma, there should be no or only minor risk of this virus infection, due to sufficient inactivation by the 60 °C 10 h liquid heating step, although we must pay attention to the composition used for blood product preparation.","hematology"
"All living organisms are continuously exposed to a plethora of viruses. In general, viruses tend to be restricted to the natural host species which they infect. From time to time viruses cross the host‐range barrier expanding their host range. However, in very rare cases cross‐species transfer is followed by the establishment and persistence of a virus in the new host species, which may result in disease. Recent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier from animal reservoirs to humans are hantavirus, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses, Nipah and Hendra viruses, avian influenza virus (AI), monkeypox virus, and the SARS‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐CoV). The opportunities for cross‐species transfer of mammalian viruses have increased in recent years due to increased contact between humans and animal reservoirs. However, it is difficult to predict when such events will take place since the viral adaptation that is needed to accomplish this is multifactorial and stochastic. Against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live‐vector vaccines is a cause for concern. This review addresses a number of potential risk factors and their implications for activities with viral vectors from the perspective of cross‐species transfer of viruses in nature, with emphasis on the occurrence of host‐range mutants resulting from either cell culture or tropism engineering. The issues are raised with the intention to assist in risk assessments for activities with vector viruses. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","medicine"
"Although chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine were originally developed for the treatment of malaria, these medications have been used to treat skin disease for over 50 years. Recent clinical data have confirmed the usefulness of these medications for the treatment of lupus erythematosus. Current research has further enhanced our understanding of the pharmacologic mechanisms of action of these drugs involving inhibition of endosomal toll‐like receptor (TLR) signaling limiting B cell and dendritic cell activation. With this understanding, the use of these medications in dermatology is broadening. This article highlights the different antimalarials used within dermatology through their pharmacologic properties and mechanism of action, as well as indicating their clinical uses. In addition, contraindications, adverse effects, and possible drug interactions of antimalarials are reviewed.","dermatology"
"Background and Objectives  Human plasma is the source of a wide variety of therapeutic proteins, yet it is also a potential source of viral contamination. Recent outbreaks of emergent viral pathogens, such as West Nile virus, and the use of live vaccinia virus as a vaccine have prompted a reassessment of the viral safety of plasma‐derived products. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of current viral inactivation methods for West Nile and vaccinia viruses and to reassess the use of model viruses to predict inactivation of similar viral pathogens. Materials and Methods  Virus‐spiked product intermediates were processed using a downscaled representation of various manufacturing procedures. Virus infectivity was measured before and after processing to determine virus inactivation. Results  The results demonstrated effective inactivation of West Nile virus, vaccinia virus and a model virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, during pasteurization, solvent/detergent treatment and caprylate treatment. Caprylate provided rapid and effective inactivation of West Nile virus, vaccinia virus, duck hepatitis B virus and Sindbis virus. Inactivation of West Nile virus was similar to that of bovine viral diarrhoea virus. Conclusions  This study demonstrates that procedures used to inactivate enveloped viruses in manufacturing processes can achieve inactivation of West Nile virus and vaccinia virus. In addition, the data support the use of model viruses to predict the inactivation of similar emergent viral pathogens.","hematology"
"Glycyrrhizin, a biological active compound isolated from the liquorice root, has been used as a treatment for chronic hepatitis. We have examined the involvement of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‐9 in the development of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D‐galactosamine (GalN)‐induced liver injury in mice. We also investigated the effect of glycyrrhizin on expression of MMP‐9 in this model. Levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased after LPS/GalN treatment. Expression of MMP‐9 mRNA and protein was markedly up‐regulated in liver tissues 6–8 h after LPS/GalN treatment. Pretreatment with glycyrrhizin (50 mg kg−1) and the MMP inhibitor (5 mg kg−1) suppressed increases in serum levels of ALT and AST in mice treated with LPS/GalN. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin inhibited levels of both mRNA and protein for MMP‐9. Immunohistochemical reaction for MMP‐9 was observed in macrophages/monocytes infiltrated in the inflammatory area of liver injury. Glycyrrhizin reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and immunoreactive MMP‐9 in liver injury. The results indicated that MMP‐9 played a role in the development of LPS/GalN‐induced mouse liver injury, and suggested that an inhibition by glycyrrhizin of the acute liver injury may have been due to a down‐regulation of MMP‐9.","pharmacology"
"To date, the SARS coronavirus is the only known highly pathogenic human coronavirus. In 2003, it was responsible for a large outbreak associated with a 10% fatality rate. This positive RNA virus encodes a large replicase polyprotein made up of 16 gene products (nsp1–16), amongst which two methyltransferases, nsp14 and nsp16, are involved in viral mRNA cap formation. The crystal structure of nsp16 is unknown. Nsp16 is an RNA‐cap AdoMet‐dependent (nucleoside‐2′‐O‐)‐methyltransferase that is only active in the presence of nsp10. In this paper, the expression, purification and crystallization of nsp10 in complex with nsp16 are reported. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 Å resolution and crystal structure determination is in progress.","crystallography"
"Scope: Dieckol is a major polyphenol of Ecklonia cava. This study demonstrates a mechanistic role for dieckol in the suppression of lipid accumulation using three models. Methods and results: Mice were split into four experimental groups (n = 10 per group): normal diet, high‐fat diet (HFD), and dieckol‐supplemented diets. Dieckol‐supplemented mice groups showed a significant decrease of body weight gain (38%) as well as fats of organs including epididymal (45%) compared with a HFD‐fed group. LDL cholesterol level was reduced by 55% in dieckol‐supplemented group. Adipogenic factors and lipid synthetic enzymes were analyzed via real‐time PCR or immunoblotting. Dieckol regulated mRNA expressions of early adipogenic genes in 3T3‐L1 cells. These results were reflected in downregulation of late adipogenic factors, resulting in a decrease in triacylglycerol content. These data were also verified in zebrafish and mouse models. Dieckol activated AMP‐activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) signaling to inhibit lipid synthesis in 3T3‐L1 and mouse model. Dieckol was also shown to inhibit mitotic clonal expansion via cell‐cycle arrest. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that dieckol inhibits lipid accumulation via activation of AMPKα signaling and cell‐cycle arrest.","food"

"Fish and shellfish diseases are a constant threat to the sustainability and economic viability of aquaculture. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in management of fish and shellfish diseases. Traditionally, various biochemical and serological tests have been used for fish disease diagnosis. However, the time and expertise required for such diagnoses makes it difficult for aquaculturists to easily adopt them under production conditions. Polymerase chain reaction and probe‐based nucleic acid detection have become increasingly popular in fish and shellfish diagnostics. Recently, a novel technique called loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed, which is highly sensitive and rapid. LAMP has been used for the detection of bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic diseases in both animal and plants. In aquaculture, LAMP‐based detection of pathogens like Edwardsiella tarda, E. ictaluri, Nocardia seriolae, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, white spot syndrome virus and infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus have been reported. In this review, the application of LAMP for the detection of aquaculture‐associated pathogens is discussed.","veterinary"
"The phenomenon that SARS coronavirus main protease (SARS Mpro) dimer is the main functional form has been confirmed by experiment. However, because of the absence of structural information of the monomer, the reasons for this remain unknown. To investigate it, two molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water for dimer and monomer models have been carried out, using the crystal structure of protomer A of the dimer as the starting structure for the monomer. During the MD simulation of dimer, three interest phenomena of protomer A have been observed: (i) the distance between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 averages 3.72 Å, which agrees well with the experimental observations made by X‐ray crystallography; (ii) His163 and Glu166 form the “tooth” conformational properties, resulting in the specificity for glutamine at substrate P1 site; and (iii) the substrate‐binding pocket formed by loop 140–146 and loop 184–197 is large enough to accommodate the substrate analog. However, during the MD simulation of the monomer complex, the three structural characteristics are all absent, which results directly in the inactivation of the monomer. Throughout the MD simulation of the dimer, the N‐terminus of protomer B forms stable hydrogen bonds with Phe140 and Glu166, through which His163, Glu166, and loop 140–146 are kept active form. Furthermore, a water‐bridge has been found between the N‐terminus of protomer B and Gly170, which stabilizes His172 and avoids it moving toward Tyr161 to disrupt the H‐bond between Tyr161 and His163, stabilizing the conformation of His163. The interactions between the N‐terminus and another monomer maintain the activity of dimer. Proteins 2007. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","biophysics"
"To estimate the public and animal health risk that alien species pose, the prevalence of Salmonella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter spp. in feral raccoons (Procyon lotor, n = 459) and masked palm civets (Paguma larvata, n = 153), which are abundant alien species in Japan, was investigated in urban and suburban areas of Japan. Salmonella enterica was detected from 29 samples [26 raccoons, 5.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8–3.5%; three masked palm civets, 2.0%, 95% CI 4.2–0%]. Many of the isolates belonged to serovars that are commonly isolated from human gastroenteritis patients (e.g. S. Infantis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Thompson). The antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that 26.9 % of the isolates from raccoons were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, whereas none of the isolates from masked palm civets were resistant. Yersinia sp. was detected from 193 samples (177 raccoons, 38.6%, 95% CI 43.0–34.1%; 16 masked palm civets, 10.5%, 95% CI 15.3–5.6%). All virulent Yersinia strains belonged to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which was isolated from seven (1.5%, 95% CI 2.6–0.4%) raccoons and six (3.9%, 95% CI 7.0–0.8%) masked palm civets. According to the detection of virulence factors, all the Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates belonged to the Far Eastern systemic pathogenicity type. Campylobacter spp. was detected from 17 samples (six raccoons, 1.3%, 95% CI 2.3–0.3%; 11 masked palm civets, 7.2%, 95% CI 11.3–3.1%). Among these, three isolates from raccoons were identified as C. jejuni. These results showed that these pathogens can be transmitted by human activities, other wild animals, and the environment to feral raccoons and masked palm civets, and vice versa. As these animals have omnivorous behaviour and a wide range of habitats, they can play an important role in the transmission of the enteric pathogens.","veterinary"
"Between April 2012 and June 2014, 820 laboratory‐confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) have been reported in the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the United States. The observed epidemiology is different to SARS, which showed a classic epidemic curve and was over in eight months. The much longer persistence of MERS‐CoV in the population, with a lower reproductive number, some evidence of human‐to‐human transmission but an otherwise sporadic pattern, is difficult to explain. Using available epidemiological data, we implemented mathematical models to explore the transmission dynamics of MERS‐CoV in the context of mass gatherings such as the Hajj pilgrimage, and found a discrepancy between the observed and expected epidemiology. The fact that no epidemic occurred in returning Hajj pilgrims in either 2012 or 2013 contradicts the long persistence of the virus in human populations. The explanations for this discrepancy include an ongoing, repeated nonhuman/sporadic source, a large proportion of undetected or unreported human‐to‐human cases, or a combination of the two. Furthermore, MERS‐CoV is occurring in a region that is a major global transport hub and hosts significant mass gatherings, making it imperative to understand the source and means of the yet unexplained and puzzling ongoing persistence of the virus in the human population.","social"
"The interferon‐induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins protect host cells from diverse virus infections. IFITM proteins also incorporate into HIV‐1 virions and inhibit virus fusion and cell‐to‐cell spread, with IFITM3 showing the greatest potency. Here, we report that amino‐terminal mutants of IFITM3 preventing ubiquitination and endocytosis are more abundantly incorporated into virions and exhibit enhanced inhibition of HIV‐1 fusion. An analysis of primate genomes revealed that IFITM3 is the most ancient antiviral family member of the IFITM locus and has undergone a repeated duplication in independent host lineages. Some IFITM3 genes in nonhuman primates, including those that arose following gene duplication, carry amino‐terminal mutations that modify protein localization and function. This suggests that “runaway” IFITM3 variants could be selected for altered antiviral activity. Furthermore, we show that adaptations in IFITM3 result in a trade‐off in antiviral specificity, as variants exhibiting enhanced activity against HIV‐1 poorly restrict influenza A virus. Overall, we provide the first experimental evidence that diversification of IFITM3 genes may boost the antiviral coverage of host cells and provide selective functional advantages.","cell"

"Infectious particles can be deposited on surfaces. Susceptible persons who contacted these contaminated surfaces may transfer the pathogens to their mucous membranes via hands, leading to a risk of respiratory infection. The exposure and infection risk contributed by this transmission route depend on indoor surface material, ventilation, and human behavior. In this study, quantitative infection risk assessments were used to compare the significances of these factors. The risks of three pathogens, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus, in an aircraft cabin and in a hospital ward were assessed. Results showed that reducing the contact rate is relatively more effective than increasing the ventilation rate to lower the infection risk. Nonfabric surface materials were found to be much more favorable in the indirect contact transmission for RSV and rhinovirus than fabric surface materials. In the cases considered in this study, halving the ventilation rate and doubling the hand contact rate to surfaces and the hand contact rate to mucous membranes would increase the risk by 3.7–16.2%, 34.4–94.2%, and 24.1–117.7%, respectively. Contacting contaminated nonfabric surfaces may pose an indirect contact risk up to three orders of magnitude higher than that of contacting contaminated fabric surfaces. These findings provide more consideration for infection control and building environmental design.","social"
"Recently, a new coronavirus was isolated from the lung tissue of autopsy sample and nasal/throat swabs of the patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the causative association with SARS was determined. To reveal further the characteristics of the virus and to provide insight about the molecular mechanism of SARS etiology, a proteomic strategy was utilized to identify the structural proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) isolated from Vero E6 cells infected with the BJ‐01 strain of the virus. At first, Western blotting with the convalescent sera from SARS patients demonstrated that there were various structural proteins of SARS‐CoV in the cultured supernatant of virus infected‐Vero E6 cells and that nucleocaspid (N) protein had a prominent immunogenicity to the convalescent sera from the patients with SARS, while the immune response of spike (S) protein probably binding with membrane (M) glycoprotein was much weaker. Then, sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE) was used to separate the complex protein constituents, and the strategy of continuous slicing from loading well to the bottom of the gels was utilized to search thoroughly the structural proteins of the virus. The proteins in sliced slots were trypsinized in‐gel and identified by mass spectrometry. Three structural proteins named S, N and M proteins of SARS‐CoV were uncovered with the sequence coverage of 38.9, 93.1 and 28.1% respectively. Glycosylation modification in S protein was also analyzed and four glycosylation sites were discovered by comparing the mass spectra before and after deglycosylation of the peptides with PNGase F digestion. Matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization‐mass spectrometry determination showed that relative molecular weight of intact N protein is 45 929 Da, which is very close to its theoretically calculated molecular weight 45 935 Da based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the genome with the first amino acid methionine at the N‐terminus depleted and second, serine, acetylated, indicating that phosphorylation does not happen at all in the predicted phosphorylation sites within infected cells nor in virus particles. Intriguingly, a series of shorter isoforms of N protein was observed by SDS‐PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry characterization. For further confirmation of this phenomenon and its related mechanism, recombinant N protein of SARS‐CoV was cleaved in vitro by caspase‐3 and ‐6 respectively. The results demonstrated that these shorter isoforms could be the products from cleavage of caspase‐3 rather than that of caspase‐6. Further, the relationship between the caspase cleavage and the viral infection to the host cell is discussed.","biochemistry"
"To identify and characterize aetiologic agent(s) associated with an outbreak of a severe diarrhoea in piglets in Jiangxi, China, in March 2015, a nested reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for the detection of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was developed. A survey based on the nested RT‐PCR established indicated that the monoinfection of PDCoV (33.71%) and coinfection of PDCoV (19.66%) with porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) were common in diarrhoeal pigs in Jiangxi, China. A high prevalence of PDCoV (58.33%) in diarrhoeal samples which were PEDV negative was observed. The complete genome sequence of a representative PDCoV strain, PDCoV/CHJXNI2/2015, was determined. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome and S protein sequences of PDCoV/CHJXNI2/2015 demonstrated that it was most closely related to Hong Kong and US PDCoVs. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification, prevalence, complete genome sequencing and molecular characterizations of PDCoV in diarrhoeal samples in pigs in China.","veterinary"
"BACKGROUND:  The INTERCEPT Blood System, a photochemical treatment (PCT) process, has been developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet concen‐trates. These studies evaluated the efficacy of PCT to inactivate pathogens in plasma and the effect of PCT on plasma function. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  Jumbo (600 mL) plasma units were inoculated with high titers of test pathogens and treated with 150 µmol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm2 long‐wavelength ultraviolet light. The viability of each pathogen before and after treatment was measured with biological assays. Plasma function was evaluated through measurement of coagulation factors and antithrombotic protein activities. RESULTS: The levels of inactivation expressed as log‐reduction were as follows: cell‐free human immunodeficiency virus‐1 (HIV‐1), greater than 6.8; cell‐associated HIV‐1, greater than 6.4; human T‐lymphotropic virus‐I (HTLV‐I), 4.5; HTLV‐II, greater than 5.7; hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus, greater than 4.5; duck HBV, 4.4 to 4.5; bovine viral diarrhea virus, 6.0; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 5.5; West Nile virus, 6.8; bluetongue virus, 5.1; human adenovirus 5, 6.8; Klebsiella pneumoniae, greater than 7.4; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Yersinia enterocolitica, greater than 7.3; Treponema pallidum, greater than 5.9; Borrelia burgdorferi, greater than 10.6; Plasmodium falciparum, 6.9; Trypanosoma cruzi, greater than 5.0; and Babesia microti, greater than 5.3. Retention of coagulation factor activity after PCT was expressed as the proportion of pretreatment (baseline) activity. Retention was 72 to 73 percent of baseline fibrinogen and Factor (F)VIII activity and 78 to 98 percent for FII, FV, FVII, F IX, FX, FXI, FXIII, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and α2‐antiplasmin. CONCLUSION: PCT of plasma inactivated high levels of a wide range of pathogens while maintaining adequate coagulation function. PCT has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion‐transmitted diseases in patients requiring plasma transfusion support.","hematology"
"The mammalian immune system is a dynamic multiscale system composed of a hierarchically organized set of molecular, cellular, and organismal networks that act in concert to promote effective host defense. These networks range from those involving gene regulatory and protein–protein interactions underlying intracellular signaling pathways and single‐cell responses to increasingly complex networks of in vivo cellular interaction, positioning, and migration that determine the overall immune response of an organism. Immunity is thus not the product of simple signaling events but rather nonlinear behaviors arising from dynamic, feedback‐regulated interactions among many components. One of the major goals of systems immunology is to quantitatively measure these complex multiscale spatial and temporal interactions, permitting development of computational models that can be used to predict responses to perturbation. Recent technological advances permit collection of comprehensive datasets at multiple molecular and cellular levels, while advances in network biology support representation of the relationships of components at each level as physical or functional interaction networks. The latter facilitate effective visualization of patterns and recognition of emergent properties arising from the many interactions of genes, molecules, and cells of the immune system. We illustrate the power of integrating ‘omics’ and network modeling approaches for unbiased reconstruction of signaling and transcriptional networks with a focus on applications involving the innate immune system. We further discuss future possibilities for reconstruction of increasingly complex cellular‐ and organism‐level networks and development of sophisticated computational tools for prediction of emergent immune behavior arising from the concerted action of these networks.

"Much can be learnt about the mechanisms by which micro‐organisms cause disease from the ways that they interact with cells and tissues. This issue of The Journal of Pathology contains articles that address the roles that cell and tissue biology and pathology are playing in the elucidation of these mechanisms. A review of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is followed by a discussion of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Two articles on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection address the association between viral infection and neoplasia, as do reviews on viruses and lymphoma/leukaemia, and Kaposi's sarcoma‐associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8, HHV8). The section on viral disease concludes with an article on morbilliviruses. The intracellular effects of bacteria are addressed in a review of Listeria infection and a further review outlines recent advances in our knowledge of syphilis. Reviews on Helicobacter and gastric neoplasia, innate defences against methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, and the function of granulomas in tuberculosis also address aspects of tissue responses to bacterial infection. Following a review of the function of immunoglobulin A in defence against infection, a group of articles considers vaccination and gene therapy approaches, the latter involving consideration of both viral and bacterial strategies. The reviews assembled here bridge several gaps: between microbiology and cellular pathology; between host and infecting organism; and between disease and therapy. It is clear that cell and tissue pathology approaches are of value in all of these spheres, providing cell and tissue relevance to microbiological and immunological observations.

"Sea lice are the most damaging parasite of marine salmonids, both economically and in terms of potential impacts on wild fish. An increasingly widely applied control is the use of cleaner fish (CF) such as wrasse that eat lice. However, such CF can carry pathogens that may cause disease in salmon, including the potential emergence of new diseases. This is not just a theoretical risk, as demonstrated by a recent outbreak of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia in wrasse held on salmon farms in Shetland. A modelling framework is developed to identify conditions in which emergence might occur, and, from this, means of reducing risk. Diseases that might emerge easily in farmed salmon would be likely to have already done so by other routes of exposure, and if risks are very low, they would need to be greatly enhanced to become significant relative to costs of lice control. CF may most enhance risks from disease with moderate probability of emerging. Risks of emergence can be reduced by replacing wild‐caught with hatchery‐reared CF, minimizing mixing of CF from different sources, surveillance for clinical disease in the CF and ensuring strategic biosecurity (area management with synchronized fallowing). Reuse of CF for a second salmon production cycle may reduce costs and even probability of infection (especially from wild‐caught CF), but should only be considered as part of a rigorous area management programme because the practice presents opportunities for pathogens to adapt to salmon by weakening fallowing.","veterinary"
"In spite of recent improvements in docking and scoring methods, high false‐positive rates remain a common issue in structure‐based virtual screening. In this study, the distinctive features of false positives in kinase virtual screens were investigated. A series of retrospective virtual screens on kinase targets was performed on specifically designed test sets, each combining true ligands and experimentally confirmed inactive compounds. A systematic analysis of the docking poses generated for the top‐ranking compounds highlighted key aspects differentiating true hits from false positives. The most recurring feature in the poses of false positives was the absence of certain key interactions known to be required for kinase binding. A systematic analysis of 444 crystal structures of ligand‐bound kinases showed that at least two hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the backbone protein atoms in the kinase hinge region are present in 90% of the complexes, with very little variability across targets. Closer inspection showed that when the two hydrogen bonds are present, one of three preferred hinge‐binding motifs is involved in 96.5% of the cases. Less than 10% of the false positives satisfied these two criteria in the minimized docking poses generated by our standard protocol. Ligand conformational artifacts were also shown to contribute to the occurrence of false positives in a number of cases. Application of this knowledge in the form of docking constraints and post‐processing filters provided consistent improvements in virtual screening performance on all systems. The false‐positive rates were significantly reduced and the enrichment factors increased by an average of twofold. On the basis of these results, a generalized two‐step protocol for virtual screening on kinase targets is suggested. Proteins 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","biophysics"

"Transfusion safety relating to blood‐transmissible agents is a major public health concern, particularly when faced with the continuing emergence of new infectious agents. These include new viruses appearing alongside other known reemerging viruses (West Nile virus, Chikungunya) as well as new strains of bacteria and parasites (Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi) and finally pathologic prion protein (variant Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease). Genomic mutations of known viruses (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus) can also be at the origin of variants susceptible to escaping detection by diagnostic tests. New technologies that would allow the simultaneous detection of several blood‐transmissible agents are now needed for the development and improvement of screening strategies. DNA microarrays have been developed for use in immunohematology laboratories for blood group genotyping. Their application in the detection of infectious agents, however, has been hindered by additional technological hurdles. For instance, the variability among and within genomes of interest complicate target amplification and multiplex analysis. Advances in biosensor technologies based on alternative detection strategies have offered new perspectives on pathogen detection; however, whether they are adaptable to diagnostic applications testing biologic fluids is under debate. Elsewhere, current nanotechnologies now offer new tools to improve the sample preparation, target capture, and detection steps. Second‐generation devices combining micro‐ and nanotechnologies have brought us one step closer to the potential development of innovative and multiplexed approaches applicable to the screening of blood for transmissible agents.","hematology"
"BACKGROUND: Viral contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in transfusion‐transmitted diseases. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen‐HCl and long‐wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross‐links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate viruses and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic or blood‐borne viruses, representing 10 different families, were added to single‐donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 × 1011 to 6.0 × 1011 PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol). After PCT with 150 µmol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm2 UVA, residual viral infectivity was assayed by sensitive cell culture or animal systems. RESULTS: Enveloped viruses were uniformly sensitive to inactivation by PCT whereas nonenveloped viruses demonstrated variable inactivation. Log reduction of enveloped viruses for cell‐free HIV‐1 was >6.2; for cell‐associated HIV‐1, >6.1; for clinical isolate HIV‐1, >3.4; for clinical isolate HIV‐2, >2.5; for HBV, >5.5; for HCV, >4.5; for DHBV, >6.2; for BVDV, >6.0; for HTLV‐I, 4.2; for HTLV‐II, 4.6; for CMV, >5.9; for WNV, >5.5; for SARS‐HCoV, >5.8; and for vaccinia virus, >4.7. Log reduction of nonenveloped viruses for human adenovirus 5 was >5.2; for parvovirus B19, 3.5‐>5.0; for bluetongue virus, 5.6‐5.9; for feline conjunctivitis virus, 1.7‐2.4; and for simian adenovirus 15, 0.7‐2.3. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic, blood‐borne viruses. Inactivation of viruses in PLT concentrates with amotosalen and UVA offers the potential to prospectively prevent the majority of PLT transfusion‐associated viral diseases.","hematology"
